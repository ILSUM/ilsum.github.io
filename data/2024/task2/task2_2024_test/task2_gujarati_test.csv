gujarati_test_0,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has laid down a proposal for cricket&amp;#8217;s inclusion in the Olympics with a large focus on India-centric audio-visual presentation. The proposal paper has put a special emphasis on the billion-plus fans of India and global icons like Virat Kohli and Mithali Raj.The virtual presentation was made last week where ICC tried to bring attention on the fact that cricket&amp;#8217;s inclusion in Los Angeles Olympic Games, 2028 can bring billion new fans.It&amp;#8217;s to be noted that ICC focused on Kohli and Mithali, keeping in view that both are quite popular in the sporting world.Kohli has around 216 million followers on Instagram alone.ALSO READ: 'Pakistan Ko Credit Dijiye Kyunki Ek Billion Dollar Team Ko Hum Harate He'- Ramiz RajaApart from the Kohli and Mithali factor, ICC also highlighted that cricket connects the Olympics with South Asia and it would bring enormous commercial opportunity that the region can offer to the Games.As a matter of record, presentation was made to LA28 and not the International Olympic Committee (IOC).Along with cricket, eight other international federations (IF) are running in the race to get included in LA28 organisers. Karate, baseball, softball, kickboxing, squash, American football, Lacrosse and break-dancing are in the list.However, the disciplines will be added on the basis of the value they can bring to the global sporting spectacle.The presentations were initially to be made over a month ago but could be done only last week. The decisions on the inclusion of the above sporting games will be made in IOC meeting scheduled in Mumbai in mid-2023.According to a report in the American media, &amp;#8220;the shortlisted IFs had to meet certain criteria outlined by LA28 and the IOC, in areas such as environmental sustainability, universality, gender equality, integrity and fairness, popularity and host country interest, athlete safety and cost and complexity.&amp;#8221;The ICC statement read, &amp;#8220;The review process for potential new sports for the LA28 Olympic sport program is ongoing. We are continuing to learn more ahead of the sport proposal submission to the IOC next year.&amp;#8221;Reportedly, it&amp;#8217;s not mandatory to include a new discipline but it&amp;#8217;s also not against the Olympics&amp;#8217; rules. However, it is to be noted that the new entrants will have to fit the cap of 10,500 athletes quota fixed by the IOC.

gujarati_test_1,"The row sparked by The Kerala Story movie, resulting in the ban of the movie in the state of West Bengal — the ban announced by none other than CM Mamata Banerjee herself — speaks of the loathing and abhorrence of the state administration. Subsequently, a popular Twitterati refuted and took a swipe: 'Padmaavat was freedom of expression; Udta Punjab was freedom of expression; Parzania was freedom of expression; PK was freedom of expression; The Kashmir Files was propaganda; The Kerala Story is propaganda. Art and freedom of expression depend on the mood of a special community.'This tweet, taken matter-of-factly, expresses the Indian—fact of the matter, a distorted—version of secularism, or the Nehruvian model of secularism that is equivalent to minorityism, so to speak. On one hand, we have seen movies like Pathaan and Tiger Zinda Hai portraying the unconvincing possibility, wherein the ISI helps R&amp;amp;AW and nobody seeks proof; on the other hand, movies like The Kerala Story show ISIS inveigling Hindu girls and all the votaries of Nehruvian secularism demand proof.The much contentious Wikipedia defines secularism as 'a movement towards the separation of religion and government, often termed the separation of church and state.' Secularism imputes the separation of religion from political, economic, social, and cultural aspects of life, the treatment of religion as a purely personal matter, the dissociation of the state from religion, and full freedom and tolerance for all religions.Renowned Indologist Dr Koenraad Elst once noted, 'Whilst in Christian Europe, secularism used to be a way of curbing the intrusive power of the churches. Ever since the term was propounded by Jawaharlal Nehru, being an Indian secularist doesn&amp;#8217;t require you to reject theocracy and the intrusion of religion into politics. On the contrary, every obscurantist in India swears by secularism.' In public discourse, (Indian) Nehruvian secularism, or minorityism, is principally a form of snobbery that confers a cheap moral superiority on self-hating Hindus to mark them off as enlightened sophisticates against the cramped and backward Hindu 'fundamentalists.' This carefully crafted and well-contrived ideology would lay the blame for Muslim grievances with the Hindu side, thus hoping to win the Muslims over at last, though no longer to the national cause nor to a polity recognisable as 'secular,' but to an arrangement that usurps this self-description while humiliating the Hindus to a point of dehumanisation. This labelling is a cardinal trait of the Marxist culture that forms the genesis of the wake culture of Wokeism. Globally, liberal secularism and militant Islam make for strange bedfellows.Last year, the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Nupur Sharma's curt quoting of the Hadiths started an orgy of violence and a spate of beheadings across the country. In truth, it was conveniently and mischievously overlooked that Nupur had only rebutted the incendiary abuse on Hindu gods by one purported Islamic scholar and PFI supporter, Tasleem Rehmani, and congruent to the customary liberal privilege, only Nupur's rebuttal cropped up invariably to showcase her as Gustakh-e-Rasool, causing the global tumultuous furore and ire in the militant Islamic world. Ever since, unfettered decrees by the Muslim mobs for her beheading have echoed the streets of secular India.This only ratified Hamid Dalwai, a Marathi Muslim scholar who, in his 1969 book, 'Muslim Politics in Secular India', critiqued appeasement politics as the furtherance of Jinnah's separatist mindset. According to him, the real problem was Muslim obscurantism — that Indian Muslims had shunned their doors and, in a way, evaded public scrutiny. In a way, they are secluding themselves from the rest of the country's majority, i.e., the Hindus. He also observed that Indian Muslims are more likely to blame Hindus than to reflect. This 'obscurantism medievalism' needs to be confronted instead of evading it using political chicanery and the charade of 'minority protection' or 'secularism.' The word&amp;#8217;s effective meaning has shifted to a point quite unknown to its European coiners, viz., the struggle against Hinduism, and is now fully crystallised as a weapon in an anti-Hindu acrimonious tirade.A purported Left-liberal eminent scholar, Neera Chandhoke, in her telling book, 'Rethinking Secularism: A View from India', notes: 'Secularism, however, is in crisis, having been subjected to overuse. While a 'thin' and limited concept, secularism in India, for example, has had to shoulder the onerous task of nation-building, take on the construction of a uniform civil code, bear responsibility for reorganizing and equalizing hierarchical relationships within religious communities, and even stand for democracy. Unable to bear the weight of too many political projects, it shows signs of imploding. The West, in the meantime, seems to have given up on secularism.'But today, India is having to firefight on two fronts: with the woke secular brigade, intellectuals, and media that shield Islam's egregious violent instincts, and the courts, occupied by Nehruvian secularists, that predominantly side with the Islamic world due to its macabre nature and the paranoia of religious persecution in India.In many key observations, the courts have repeatedly broken the fourth wall for Hindus by often critically cracking down on Hindu festivals, but extended the longest rope to the most cloistered traditions of Islam. Despite the ubiquity of endless reports discarding  Diwali s culpable for the toxic smog that floods New Delhi every year, the Apex Court ruled to ban the sale of fireworks in the Indian capital. The proliferation of subjections extends so much so that in 2016, the Supreme Court, siding with the Bombay High Court's directive, brusquely limited the height of human pyramids during the Dahi Handi celebrations to 20 feet. In 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the management of the Jagannath Puri temple to permit entry to all visitors, irrespective of their religion, to offer respect and offerings to the deity.However, the same strenuous courts contort themselves into paralysis over Islam's exceptional orthodoxies. Earlier this year, Punjab and Haryana High Courts recognised the marriage of a 15-year-old girl according to the applicable personal laws in Islam. With no victory in sight, the Apex Court has yet to ban the barbaric and regressive practice of female genital mutilation of minor girls in the Dawoodi Bohra Muslim community. In another instance of discernible bigotry, the Kerala High Court declined to entertain a plea challenging the constitutionality of the Kerala Animals and Bird Sacrifices Prohibition Act, which laughably allows the killing of animals and consuming them but prohibits sacrificing animals, offering them to the deity, and then consuming them. The SC of India, which pushed for the use of arrest powers to be used sparingly in the case of Mohammed Zubair&amp;#8217;s arrest, has now refused to intervene in the Tamil Nadu government&amp;#8217;s use of the National Securities Act against Bihar-based YouTuber Manish Kashyap.Calling out the not-so-clandestine nature of the well-oiled secularist-Islamist machinery, Dr Elst noted, 'The secularist-Islamist alliance is one of the wonders of the world and requires ever-new exercises in hypocrisy on the part of the former, sometimes descending into grotesque buffoonery.'The archaic laws that have a penchant for minority appeasement in the garb of secularism need to go for good. Bharatiya universalism has to oust and replace this phony secularism.Yuvraj Pokharna is an independent journalist and columnist. He tweets with @iyuvrajpokharna.

gujarati_test_2,"Approval of the long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine provides strength to the optimism on health and economic fronts, the Finance Ministry said in its monthly economic report. &amp;#8220;The effective management of COVID-19 spread despite the festive season and onset of the winter season, combined with sustained improvement in high-frequency indicators and V-shaped recovery along with easing of lockdown restrictions distinguish Indian economy as one riding against the COVID-wave,&amp;#8221; the report said.The new year, it said, has dawned with the approval of the long-awaited COVID-19 vaccine and initiation of vaccination drives in various countries. &amp;#8220;This gives strength to the optimism on both health and economic fronts despite continuing surge in global cases and the potential challenge of a mutant strain,&amp;#8221; the Monthly Economic Review for December said.India, the report said, &amp;#8220;has been successful in bending the COVID-curve till now, with reducing weekly/daily infections, rising recovery rate (now at around 95 per cent) and one of the world&amp;#8217;s lowest case fatality rates&amp;#8221;. The downside risk, however, remains due to the spread of the UK variant and fatigue from social distancing guidelines, it said, adding the emphasis on continued observation of &amp;#8216;COVID appropriate&amp;#8217; behaviour with the due exercise of caution and surveillance needs to be sustained.Sharing improvement in some of the high-frequency data, the report said the sustained spurt in commercial and industrial activity was further corroborated by continued growth in PMI manufacturing, power demand, persistent improvement in E-way bills generated and highway toll collection rising above pre-COVID levels. Monthly GST collections attained their record levels in December.The gross GST revenue collected in December 2020 was Rs 1,15,174 crore, the highest since the introduction of Goods and Services Tax from July 1, 2017. The liquidity situation remains comfortable as the accumulation of dollars along with the growth of currency in circulation are enhancing liquidity in the banking system despite the average daily net absorptions by the RBI rose in December compared to the preceding month, the report said.The credit growth improved sharply as reflected in strong non-food credit rise and overall credit growth, thanks to the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which continues to support robust credit disbursements to MSMEs, with Rs 2.05 lakh crore sanctioned to 80.93 lakh borrowers under ECLGS 1.0. Extension of ECLGS to 26 stressed sectors is a further boost to MSME credit growth. Credit growth is further corroborated by a sharp rise in the incremental credit deposit ratio of banks, as per the report.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","ભારતના નાણાં મંત્રાલયે જણાવ્યું છે કે COVID-19 રસીની મંજૂરીએ આરોગ્ય અને આર્થિક ક્ષેત્રોમાં આશાવાદ લાવ્યો છે. વૈશ્વિક કેસોમાં વધારો અને મ્યુટન્ટ સ્ટ્રેનની હાજરી છતાં, ભારતે વાયરસના પ્રસારને અસરકારક રીતે નિયંત્રિત કર્યો છે, સંક્રમણો ઘટી રહ્યા છે અને પુનઃપ્રાપ્તિ દર ઊંચો છે. મેન્યુફેક્ચરિંગ PMI, પાવર ડિમાન્ડ અને GST કલેક્શન જેવા મુખ્ય સૂચકોએ સતત વૃદ્ધિ દર્શાવી છે, જે V-આકારની પુનઃપ્રાપ્તિનો સંકેત આપે છે. લિક્વિડિટી સ્થિતિ આરામદાયક રહે છે અને ઇમર્જન્સી ક્રેડિટ લાઇન ગેરંટી સ્કીમ મારફતે MSMEs માટે ક્રેડિટ વૃદ્ધિમાં સુધારો થયો છે.

gujarati_test_4,"Nothing has launched the second-gen phone in the market and after building all the hype for the product (which they do quite well), it is time to see if all the talk has delivered. The Phone 2 looks to build on the early promise of the Phone 1 and Nothing has already set its sights on the premium section with only its second smartphone in the market. Nothing has become known for its transparent design and the Phone 2 takes that identity to newer and polished heights. But the questions are ringing in louder this year, now that the Phone 2 gets a starting price of Rs 44,999 going up to Rs 54,999 for the top 512GB variant. So can Nothing Phone 2 become the first choice for buyers in a market where the options are plenty? Our review here gives you the details after using the phone for over a few weeks. Nothing Phone 2 Review: What's Cool?Nothing has definitely nailed it with the design, fit and finish of the Phone 2. If you felt the Phone 1 had a premium approach, the Phone 2 goes a step further. The curved layout at the back gives it a solid grip. The recycled aluminium frame adds to its durability. All the focus is on the design of the phone once againBut talking about a Nothing phone is incomplete without taking a closer look at the back panel. Yes, it is still transparent but the Glyph LEDs have been tweaked to make it feature rich and likely to get further additions in the near future. The front and back glass panel gets Corning Gorilla Glass protection which should give you some peace of mind while keeping the phone on its backside. It has a 6.7-inch OLED display which not gets an LTPO panel with 120Hz refresh rateNothing has upgraded the OLED display which now gets an LTPO panel which offers adaptive refresh rate between 1Hz to 120Hz based on what you are doing on the phone. The screen is crisp and the colours are punchy, which is helpful when you consume a lot of textual content on the phone. And even though it supports Full HD+ resolution, you won't find it lacking in any way. The bezels on the screen are symmetrical which adds further appeal to the front of the phone and the punch hole cutout it at the top-centre this time around. The phone is powered by Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset with up to 12GB RAMThe company has bumped the performance levels of its second phone, moving from a mid range-ish to a flagship-level hardware. Using the Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chip with up to 12GB RAM delivers an excellent boost in its overall usability. You get the Nothing OS 2.0 version and promise of three more OS updatesAdding further richness to the experience is the Nothing OS 2.0 version which has to be one of the best UI we have come across outside of Google's Pixel UI. In fact, the Nothing software has elements that were the hallmark of the OxygenOS from OnePlus during Carl's stint at the company. The interface is fluid, aided by the high refresh rate screen and a powerful hardware. But there is a lot more that works seamlessly for the UI, for instance, the apps open without any lag, we didn't notice major issues while multitasking and running videos for hours without any hiccups. The dual rear cameras are 50MP IMX890 sensor with OIS and 50MP ultrawide-angle sensorThe primary camera on the Phone 2 is a 50MP Sony IMX890 sensor which is the same you get on the OnePlus 11 5G and a few other phones in this range. This camera offers crisp, detailed and colour-rich photos in bright conditions. We barely noticed any lag in the shutter speed and the processing part of the Nothing OS 2.0 polishes the image further, something people might like. The phone packs a 4700mAh battery this time, with support for 45W wired charging speedAnd finally, it is time to talk about one of the more important features on a smartphone, its battery life. The Phone 2 has a 4700mAh battery which is 200mAh more than what you had on the Phone 1 and might not sound like a big upgrade. But when you start putting the Phone 2 through the daily grind, you realise the optimisations done under the hood, and using this chip has paid rich dividends. Phone 2 was easily lasting us over a day and half in moderate usage, which means for most people it would last through a day and more. In terms of the metrics, the Phone 2 gave us 8 hours+ screen-on-time on an average over 10 days which is quite decent for the battery size the phone offers. You also have wireless charging like the Phone 1, and reverse wireless charging, in case your wireless earbuds are running low on juice. Nothing Phone 2 Review: What's Not So Cool?While the Glyph interface has its attraction, we still feel it is a work in progress. Nothing is relying on people keeping the phone on the backside to make the LEDs work effectively or offer any value. You have the Uber ride progress chart through the timer which is a new addition, you have the jazzy ringtones but the novelty value of this feature tends to wear out after a few days. The design is definitely catchy but the glass panel, especially the grey variant tends to be a fingerprint magnet and definitely slippery when you face it towards the screen. The glass panel has its consThe phone's main camera feels a bit underpowered with low light shots. However, Nothing has shown us that a few updates can fix those chinks, and we expect the same in the coming months. The ultrawide shooter clicks photos but the details can be inconsistent which negates its purpose for most users. The phone's battery life is a big plus but you only get 45W wired charging speed out of the box. Add to that, Nothing doesn't give you the charger in the box, which means you have to add another 2 grand to your overall budget when buying the Phone 2. We expected the brand to boost the speed, now that the rivals in this range offer as high as 100W charging speed. Nothing Phone 2 Review: Should You Buy It?The Phone 2 is an upgrade and there is no doubt about that. But it is not for anybody using the Phone 1. If you have a phone that is 2-3 years old by now, the Phone 2 makes sense. But here's the catch, for Rs 44,999 you only get the 8GB RAM variant of the Phone 2. So the best value Phone 2 option comes for Rs 49,999 which makes it expensive in a lot of ways. Make no mistake, the design is premium, the hardware boost is undeniable and the software is one of the best in the market. But Nothing is trying to dine in the premium table and for that, it needs more than just a premium design, especially when the competition is offering something better. So, if you are happy spending on a phone with the LEDs, crisp display, reliable performance, and solid battery life, Phone 2 is a definite choice, but you also have the iQOO Neo 7 Pro with the same chip but faster charging at a lower price or the OnePlus 11R with similar features and also at lower price tag than the Phone 2 in the market.","નથિંગ ફોન 2, નથિંગનો બીજો-જનરેશન સ્માર્ટફોન, ખૂબ જ અપેક્ષિત રહ્યો છે. ફોન પ્રીમિયમ ડિઝાઇન ધરાવે છે જેમાં પારદર્શક બેક પેનલ અને કોર્નિંગ ગોરિલા ગ્લાસ પ્રોટેક્શન છે. તેમાં 6.7-ઇંચની OLED ડિસ્પ્લે છે જેમાં LTPO પેનલ અને 120Hz રિફ્રેશ રેટ છે. તે સ્નેપડ્રેગન 8+ જન 1 ચિપસેટ દ્વારા સંચાલિત છે જેમાં 12GB સુધીની RAM છે, જે ઉત્તમ પ્રદર્શન આપે છે. ડ્યુઅલ રિયર કેમેરા, જેમાં 50MP IMX890 સેન્સર અને 50MP અલ્ટ્રાવાઇડ-ઍંગલ સેન્સર છે, સ્પષ્ટ અને વિગતવાર ફોટા કૅપ્ચર કરે છે. 4700mAh ની બેટરી સારી બેટરી લાઇફ પ્રદાન કરે છે, જોકે 45W વાયરડ ચાર્જિંગ સ્પીડ અને શામેલ ચાર્જરની અછત કેટલીક ખામીઓ છે. કુલ મળીને, જ્યારે ફોન 2"
gujarati_test_5,"Ahead of the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro launch, the current-gen OnePlus 6T is going on sale and is being offered at its lowest price yet. According to a listing on Amazon India, the 8GB RAM with 128GB storage variant of the OnePlus 6T will be available for Rs 32,999. The 8GB RAM with 256GB storage will also see a price cut, although the final price hasn't been confirmed. Notably, the 6GB RAM with 128GB variant has not seen a price cut and it will be available at the same price of Rs 37,999. The reduced price of the OnePlus 6T will be available during the Amazon Summer Sale which will begin from May 4 and will last until May 7. The OnePlus 6T runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and has a 6.41-inch Optic AMOLED display with a 2340 x 1080 resolution, which translates into 402 pixels per inch and has the tall 19.5:9 aspect ratio. There is a tiny water drop notch above the display which is being rumoured to continue on the OnePlus 7. You get dual cameras at the back, including a 16-megapixel (Sony IMX 519 sensor) camera paired with a 20-megapixel (Sony IMX 376K sensor) secondary camera. The former has an aperture of f/1.7 and a pixel size of 1.22 microns, while the latter has an aperture of f/1.7 and each pixel is 1.0 micron.

This means that it will directly compete with the 8GB RAM variants of the OnePlus 6T. OnePlus probably wants to clear out its inventory so that it keep the 6GB variant of the OnePlus 6T as its most affordable offering followed by the new OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro.

gujarati_test_6,"Home Minister Amit Shah, while coming down heavily on Kuki militant groups, has said any violation of the Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement will be dealt with sternly and the pact must be followed for peace to return.Addressing the media after his three-day whirlwind tour of strife-torn Manipur, Shah said: 'Suspension of Operation Agreement has some conditions. If they are broken then SoO can't be followed. It has to be enforced by both sides.'The comment was necessitated after the state government and intelligence agencies suspected that arms and ammunitions looted from armouries over the last few days could have been handed over to Kuki militants who are using it to fuel the violence further.Shah&amp;#8217;s comments can also be seen as tacit support for embattled chief minister N Biren Singh who had unilaterally walked out of the tripartite agreement in March this year. His decision was blamed for adding to the tension between Imphal and hill districts.Suspension of Operation AgreementThe Suspension of Operation Agreement was a tripartite ceasefire agreement between Kuki militant groups, the Union government and Manipur government signed on August 22, 2008. The primary objective of the pact was to initiate political dialogue and bring back militants to the mainstream.As per the agreement, 25 of the 30 Kuki groups would abide by the condition of not picking up arms. Government officials said more groups joined later and the number currently stands at 27.Terms of SoO AgreementOf a total of 30 militant groups, 25 are party to the pact &amp;#8212; 17 under Kuki National Organisation (KNO) and eight under the United People's Front (UPF).KNO and UPF constituents, under the agreement, were to give up their arms and abide by the Constitution of India. They were prohibited from carrying any arms except to protect their leadership and their camps. Designated camps were set up for the cadre to stay and double-lock safe rooms were set up to store the arms and ammunition that the erstwhile militants carried.The groups were to not take any steps that would violate the laws and territorial integrity of Manipur. In addition, all extortion activities were to be halted.In return, the state and central government assured that no operations would be carried out against these groups by security forces. A monthly stipend of Rs 5,000 would be paid to the cadre and financial allocation would be done to maintain the camps.What went wrong?The SoO agreement was to be reviewed and extended periodically. However, in March this year, the Manipur government withdrew from the agreement, alleging that Kuki National Army (KNA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) were 'influencing agitation among forest encroachers'. The state government had undertaken a massive drive in the hill districts against 'encroachers' and poppy cultivators. Kukis had opposed the drive, arguing that they were tribals who had dwelled on these lands for generations.The two issues culminated into violent protests after the high court asked the state to look into the ST status of Meiteis.The Imphal Police accused Kuki Independent Army cadre of looting 25 sophisticated weapons from an SoO designated camp in Churachandpur in April. A day before Shah's visit to Imphal, army recovered Insas rifle, grenade, detonator and ammunition from a truck.'The main point of SoO was that militants stay inside designated camps and keep their arms and ammunitions away. That is not being followed,' an official dealing with Manipur told News18. As per local officials, close to 1,500 arms and several rounds of ammunition have been looted.","ગૃહ મંત્રી અમિત શાહે મણિપુરની મુલાકાત દરમિયાન કુકી આતંકવાદી જૂથોની ઓપરેશન સુસ્પેન્શન (SoO) કરાર પ્રત્યે તેમની નિષ્ઠા માટે તાજેતરમાં પ્રશંસા કરી હતી. શાહે શાંતિ પ્રક્રિયાની પ્રગતિ અંગે સંતોષ વ્યક્ત કર્યો અને ત્રિપક્ષીય કરાર ચાલુ રાખવાનો રાજ્ય સરકારનો નિર્ણય વખાણ્યો. તેમણે કુકી આતંકવાદીઓને મુખ્ય પ્રવાહમાં સ્થાનાંતરિત કરવામાં મદદ કરવા માટે ઉન્નત સૈન્ય તાલીમ પ્રદાન કરવાની નવી પહેલની પણ જાહેરાત કરી. જોતાં, શાહે આતંકવાદીઓ માટે સ્ટાઇપેન્ડમાં વધારો કરવાની જાહેરાત કરી અને તેમના કેમ્પોના વિકાસ માટે વધારાનો નાણાકીય સહાય આપવાની પ્રતિજ્ઞા લીધી."

With his recent film Zara Hatke Zara Bachke garnering immense success at the box office, the actor is eagerly looking forward to his next few releases. However, ahead of that, in a recent interview, the actor expressed that he doesn&amp;#8217;t feel like a &amp;#8216;star&amp;#8217; and that the label only belongs to prominent actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan. He also compared today&amp;#8217;s stardom to &amp;#8216;instant coffee&amp;#8217;. During a conversation with Spice Limelight, Vicky got candid about his definition of stardom and why he doesn&amp;#8217;t consider himself a &amp;#8216;star&amp;#8217;. He explained, &amp;#8220;The adulation he received from his fans was unbelievable. I wanted to meet him and despite my father being a film technician who has worked with Hrithik, I could only meet him once. The fact that I had to work hard to see him mattered.&amp;#8221;Emphasizing his point further, the Zara Hatke Zara Bachke actor quoted the names of some real stars, &amp;#8220;The accessibility today is such that a person is a star only till he or she is in the news or trending on social media. A real star has to have longevity - like Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan and Hrithik. Earlier in Bollywood, stardom came after decades of hard work and that fame was for life. Today, stardom is easily attainable-like instant coffee. You can even buy followers, fans, ticks and verifications. Today's stardom is like fast food. I am grateful for the love I receive from my audience, but I do not feel like a star.'Vicky Kaushal is currently one of the most bankable actors in Bollywood. Through his performance, he has created a niche for himself in a very less time. But this success has not let him forget his roots. In an interview with Film Companion, Vicky said that success has not changed anything in him as middle-class values have been drilled into him.In the interview, he revealed how his mother sometimes teases him. Recalling a funny anecdote, the Zara Hatke Zara Bachke actor said, 'I remember, in 2018 or 2019, one of the leading publications put me on a list of the 'most desirable' men. And I had come back from a trip where I'd had great fun with friends. We ate a lot, so I was a little (gestures to suggest that he was overweight). And I came back, I was lying down, shirt open, and my mom is like, 'Ae dekh lo, yeh hai most desirable'. When you get trolled at home, you remain grounded. Internet can't shake me.'In the same interview, he even praised his wife Katrina Kaif. 'Knowing her, not everything was going as per her, she has really hustled and worked hard and aced it. I don't want to cross a line on her behalf but I truly feel that like there was Hema Malini's era, Rekha's era and I truly feel she has achieved that sort of milestone on her merit,' he added.Vicky Kaushal and Katrina Kaif tied the knot in 2021 in an intimate ceremony at Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan.On the work front, Vicky Kaushal's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke with Sara Ali Khan received a positive response and managed to have success at the box office. He will be next seen in Sam Bahadur. It is directed by Meghna Gulzar and is expected to hit theatres in December of this year.

gujarati_test_10,"Green Top has embedded itself like a thorn at the heart of the disengagement process on the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and is threatening to poison the wider India-China talks aimed at drawing down troops before the winter, government sources have told News18.

People's Liberation Army negotiators declined to commit to remove troops from the tactically-significant location near Pangong Lake during the marathon talks held at the Chinese base of Moldo on Sunday.

A bush-covered plateau perched at over 5,000 metres on a ridge stretching out from Pangong's north shore, Green Top is one of a handful of locations on which PLA and Indian Army negotiators remain deadlocked despite five rounds of high-level talks.

New Delhi hopes parallel diplomatic efforts, involving both the Ministry of External Affairs and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, could help resolve the disputes over Green Top, Patrol Point 17A near Gogra, and Patrol Point 13 near the Depsang Plains.

Last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin had said 'most of the bases deployed on the front have completed the evacuation process and the ground conditions are recovering'. He acknowledged the existence of 'remaining outstanding issues'.

But, officials say scepticism is mounting in the government about the PLA's willingness to withdraw from all territories it occupied in April. 'The talks have achieved their immediate intent, which was to avoid violence,' a senior intelligence official said. 'The fact that China is still occupying territory it grabbed in April may not be a deal-breaker, but it certainly undermines trust'.

PLA commanders, government sources say, are seeking to hold on to Green Top because it offers a clear line of observation over Dhan Singh Post, the main logistics hub for Indian troop movements around Pangong Lake. In the negotiations, the PLA has claimed its position on Green Top is legitimised by the build-up of Indian roads and communications infrastructure in the area—in turn, a response to years of construction work by China.

'Their argument is that India has also violated the status-quo in the Pangong area,' an officer familiar with the talks said. 'This claim has no basis, because all the works India has undertaken are clearly on our own side of the LAC'.

From Green Top, connected by road to PLA bases near Sirijap, the PLA is able to observe Indian Army patrols headed out eastwards towards the LAC, thus enabling rapid interdiction.

Eight 'Fingers', or ridges, radiating from the north shore of Pangong Lake, are contested by China and India. India claims the LAC runs near Finger 8, west of China's forward bases at Sirijap, and has long despatched patrols to the area. This summer, though, the PLA dug in at Finger 4—where Green Top is located—obstructing Indian patrols from moving westwards.

Force levels have thinned significantly all the way to Finger 5, government sources say, but the PLA has continued to maintain its presence at Green Top.

India had maintained a permanent position at Finger 7 until the 1999 Kargil war, when it was evacuated to provide troops for the conflict with Pakistan. The PLA then built roads into the sector, ensuring the post could not be re-established.

Located in the shadow of Karam Singh Hill—named for the Central Reserve Police Force officer who led the unit involved in a murderous 1959 ambush which claimed the lives of ten Indian personnel—Patrol Point 17A, near Gogra, has emerged as second key point of contestation.

Even though troops are no longer engaged in eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation, the PLA has continued to maintain a small presence near Point 17A, instead of pulling back.

China long ago pushed into parts of the LAC around Gogra, and the nearby Hot Springs area—notably, building a road that cuts across Indian-claimed territory north of the 6,300 metre Changlung La pass, and then traverses Point 15 to enter the Galwan Valley.

Patrol Points, numbered north to south with Point 1 located at the Karakoram Pass, make the physical limits to which Indian soldiers assert their presence on the LAC.

To the north of the Galwan Valley—the site of the murderous PLA ambush on June 15 clash, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed—China has continued to build road-works at Point 13. The Indian Army fears the new works could join up with existing roads built on the Indian side of the LAC near Burtsé, and eventually cut off Indian troops seeking to patrol the Depsang Plains.

No official maps recording the two sides' claims have been made public, but the scholar P Stobdan has recorded that China asserts rights to 972 square kilometres of territory on the Indian side of the LAC in the Depsang Plains, 176 sq. km. along the Samar Lungpa river, 38 sq. km. at Hot Spring, 13 sq. kilometres in Changlung, 5 sq. km. in Kungkala-Phobrang, 129 sq. km in Sirijap; 24 sq. km in Spanggur, and 25 sq. km. in Dhumtsele'. In addition, there are Chinese claims of 83 sq. km. in the Pangong area, and 80 sq. km. in Chumar.

'The territories China is trying to hold on to all lie in the disputed zones,' a senior government official said. 'In the event they do not vacate them, there will be good reason for suspicion about their course of action, going forward'.

Future talks, the official said, will focus on re-instituting patrols, suspended by both armies after the violent clash in the Galwan Valley, and creating a system to avoid face-offs between troops. New Delhi has been seeking wider discussions to firm up the LAC, but several proposals to engage in border-demaraction have been rejected by China.","લદ્દાખમાં વાસ્તવિક નિયંત્રણ રેખા (એલએસી) પર ગ્રીન ટોપ વિસ્તાર ભારત અને ચીન વચ્ચે વિસર્જન પ્રક્રિયામાં એક મુખ્ય અવરોધ બની ગયો છે, જે વ્યાપક ચર્ચામાં પ્રગતિને જોખમમાં મૂકીને. પાંચ રાઉન્ડની ચર્ચા છતાં, પીફલ્સ લિબેરેશન આર્મી (પીએલએ) એ ગ્રીન ટોપમાંથી સૈનિકોને દૂર કરવા માટે ઇન્કાર કર્યો છે, જે ભારતીય સૈન્યની ગતિવિધિઓ પર લાભદાયી નિરીક્ષણ પૂરી પાડે છે. પીએલએ દલીલ કરે છે કે ભારતે આ વિસ્તારમાં યથાસ્થિતિનું ઉલ્લંઘન કર્યું છે, જેનો ભારતીય અધિકારીઓ દ્વારા વિવાદ કરવામાં આવ્યો છે. અન્ય વિવાદિત સ્થળોમાં ગોગરા નજીક પેટ્રોલ પોઈન્ટ 17એ અને દેપસાંગના મેદાનો નજીક પેટ્રોલ પોઈન્ટ 13 શામેલ છે. ચર્ચા ગશ્તને ફરી સ્થાપિત કરવા અને ટકરાવ ટાળવા પર કેન્દ્રિત રહેશે."

The School Education Department delayed the reopening of schools earlier this month because of the heat and rising temperatures across the state. The revised timetable states that Classes 6 to 12 have begun, while Classes 1 and 5 will resume on June 14.To protect students from the extreme heat in different parts of the state, Chief Minister M. K. Stalin's directive led to the decision of pushing back the reopening date. Meanwhile, Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, the Minister of School Education of Tamil Nadu emphasised the necessity of maintaining student safety amidst the rising temperature.Initially, schools were supposed to reopen on June 7. The School Education Department had to change the schedule, though, due to worries about the weather and high temperatures. Classes 1 to 5 were originally scheduled to resume on June 5, with classes 6 to 12 starting on June 1.Following the recent declaration, chief educational authorities in districts like Chennai and Chengalpattu issued circulars directing all schools, whether public, aided, or private, to abide by the announced reopening dates. Strict mechanisms were put in place to ensure compliance and district-level officials were in charge of keeping an eye on the issue and taking appropriate action.Schools in the Chengalpattu district were specifically told not to hold senior school special classes before the scheduled reopening dates, and any infractions would result in departmental repercussions, according to reports. The government of Tamil Nadu said that it is dedicated to putting students' needs first and upholding a safe learning environment despite adverse weather circumstances when schools resume operations there.Doctors have urged people to take precautions as schools get ready to welcome students so that they can stay safe in the heat. 'Children should not be exposed to direct sunlight, and it will help if schools schedule PT periods at the end of the day, avoiding 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. It is important that students are seated in well-ventilated classrooms that aren't very crowded,' Rema Chandramohan, Director, Institute of Child Health said as per The Hindu.","તમિલનાડુમાં સ્કૂલોએ કક્ષા 6થી 12 માટે ફરીથી ખોલી છે, કારણ કે ભારે ગરમી અને વધતી તાપમાનને કારણે વિલંબ થયો હતો. સુધારેલી ટાઇમટેબલ મુજબ, કક્ષા 1 અને 5 14 જૂનથી ફરી શરૂ થશે. વિદ્યાર્થીઓને ભારે ગરમીથી બચાવવા માટે ફરીથી ખોલવાની તારીખ આગળ ધપાવવાનો નિર્ણય લેવામાં આવ્યો હતો. નવી ટાઇમટેબલનું પાલન સુનિશ્ચિત કરવા માટે કડક પગલાં લેવામાં આવ્યા છે, અને કોઈપણ ઉલ્લંઘનના પરિણામે પરિણામ આવશે. ડોકટરોએ સ્કૂલોને સાવચેતી રાખવા માટે સલાહ આપેલી છે, જેમ કે સીધી સૂર્યપ્રકાશથી બચવું અને દિવસના અંતે શારીરિક શિક્ષણના પિરિયડને શેડ્યૂલ કરવું જેથી વિદ્યાર્થીઓને ગરમીમાં સુરક્ષિત રાખી શકાય."
gujarati_test_12,"A $4.5 billion deal under which Alphabet's Google will collaborate with India's Reliance Industries on a new smartphone likely heralds a big shake-up for the world's second-largest mobile market, industry executives and analysts say. Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani, announcing the partnership at his company's annual meeting last week, said Google would build an Android operating system (OS) to power a low-cost '4G or even 5G' smartphone that Reliance would design.

The new phone is set to pose a major challenge to Chinese vendors such as Xiaomi and BBK Electronics, owner of the Realme, Oppo and Vivo brands, which currently dominate a $2 billion market for sub-$100 smartphones in India. Powered by a clever mix of Bollywood, cricket-driven marketing and product features such as powerful cameras, the Chinese firms sell roughly eight of every 10 smartphones in the country.

'If history is anything to go by, Reliance will undercut other brands and pose a real threat to the low-end smartphone market,' said Rushabh Doshi of tech researcher Canalys. Reliance executed a similar plan in 2017 with the launch of the JioPhone, a no-frills device that gave users internet access for as little as $20. JioPhone now has more 100 million users, many of whom are internet first-timers.

'They (the Chinese players) are likely to cut their price to compete and their margins could shrink,' said A Gururaj, the former India head of contract manufacturers Wistron and Flextronics. 'I see the Google-Jio phone as a big hit.' Reliance's ambition to hand a smartphone to every Indian could also win subscribers from telecoms rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, who still have hundreds of millions of users with old-style feature phones on basic 2G networks.

Realme declined to comment. Reliance, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo did not respond to requests for comment. Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The alliance will see Google invest $4.5 billion in Reliance's digital unit, which houses telecoms and fibre businesses as well as music and movie apps. Jio Platforms has also since April won the backing of global financial and tech investors including Intel and Qualcomm, which could bolster its smartphone ambitions.

While Reliance has given no details on the specifications or price of the new smartphone, the timing of its launch, or who might build it, the Jio network's 387 million subscribers and the Google brand name will give it a big leg up. The Reliance-Google phone would likely be optimised for the Jio network and offer users improved performance, said Arvind Vohra, a tech consultant and the former India head of China's Gionee.

Just as important are the possibilities for bundling Jio's massive video and music libraries with the phone. Google's Android team also aims to ensure access to apps related to health, communications and jobs, and ease of use for first-time smartphone owners, Sameer Samat, vice president for Android and Play at Google, told Reuters. That kind of packaging could help woo roughly 350 million Indians who still use basic, non-touch phones and are yet to taste high-speed mobile data on fancier devices.

'This will help users choose a device for its software and bundled content rather than just specs alone,' said Vohra. The collaboration with Google could also set the stage for further partnerships between smartphone makers and Reliance to make devices specifically for the Jio telecoms network, said analysts.

Some Jio customers are already making plans to upgrade to the Reliance-Google smartphone when it hits the market. 'I'd like to try the new Reliance smartphone and since I'm already a Jio customer my first preference will be to remain with the network,' said Rawil Ansari, a construction worker from a village in India's eastern Bihar state, who has been using a JioPhone for the past two years.","અલ્ફાબેટના ગૂગલે ભારતના રિલાયન્સ ઇન્ડસ્ટ્રીઝ સાથે $4.5 બિલિયનના સોદામાં પ્રવેશ કર્યો છે, જેમાં તેઓ નવા સ્માર્ટફોન પર સહકાર કરશે, જે વિશ્વના બીજા સૌથી મોટા મોબાઇલ બજારમાં ભંગાણ લાવશે. રિલાયન્સ એક નીચી કિંમતવાળો સ્માર્ટફોન ડિઝાઇન કરશે, જેને ગૂગલ દ્વારા બનાવેલા એન્ડ્રોઇડ ઓપરેટિંગ સિસ્ટમ દ્વારા સંચાલિત કરવામાં આવશે. આ પગલું શાઓમી અને બીબીકે ઇલેક્ટ્રોનિક્સ જેવા ચાઇનીઝ વેચાણકારો માટે એક મહત્વપૂર્ણ પડકાર રજૂ કરે છે, જે હાલમાં ભારતમાં $100 થી ઓછા કિંમતી સ્માર્ટફોન બજારમાં પ્રભુત્વ ધરાવે છે. સ્પર્ધકોની કિંમતોને ઘટાડવાની રિલાયન્સની વ્યૂહરચના ચાઇનીઝ ખેલાડીઓ માટે નફાને ઘટાડે છે. ઉપરાંત, દરેક ભારતીયને સ્માર્ટફોન આપવા માટેની રિલાયન્સની મહત્ત્વાકાંક્ષા વોડાફોન આઇડિયા અને ભારતી એરટેલ જેવા ટેલિકોમ પ્રતિસ્પર્ધીઓમાંથી ગ્રાહકોને આકર્ષી શકે છે."

His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander House), Mianwali airbase and the ISI building in Faisalabad. The Army Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi was also attacked by the mob for the first time.Police put the death toll in violent clashes to 10 while Khan&amp;#8217;s party claims 40 of its workers lost their lives in the firing by security personnel.Thousands of Khan's supporters were arrested following the violence that the powerful Army described as a 'dark day' in the history of the country.Prime Minister Sharif said that it was not a joke that terrorists attacked air force installations in Karachi and then scores of 'Imran's people set fire to the plane in Mianwali' that was used against the enemy.&amp;#8220;I had requested the Punjab chief minister about the anti-terrorism courts, prosecutors, FIRs […] and I told the interior minister and Director General Intelligence Bureau to fulfill their responsibilities as well,&amp;#8221; he said.The prime minister likened the 'PTI's violence on May 9' to the acts of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan terror group.TTP set fire to the Jinnah House in Ziarat (Balochistan) and the PTI set fire to Jinnah House in Lahore … which is now the Core Commander's residence.'TTP attacked the GHQ [General Headquarters] and these enemies of the state … the PTI … also attacked the GHQ,' Sharif, also the president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, said.He also said that rioters also vandalised state-run Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar.'These events will psychologically affect the nation for years to come,' he said.He also reiterated that people who attacked military installations would be tried under laws in the Constitution.'On the other hand, people who were involved in attacks on civilian institutions will be tried under the Anti-Terrorism Act in civil courts,' he said.He also termed the May 9 violence as a 'Black Day' in the history of the country.'It will be remembered as the day when terrorism was carried out against the state by goon on the orders of Imran Niazi,' he said.Niazi is the tribal surname of Imran Khan but he never used it in his cricketing years as a politician but Prime Minister Sharif and many other leaders use it as a taunt.","પાકિસ્તાનના વડા પ્રધાન શહબાઝ શરીફે વચન આપ્યું છે કે 9 મેના રોષક વિરોધ પ્રદર્શનોમાં જોડાયેલા લોકો, જેમાં સૈન્ય સ્થાપનાઓ અને રાજ્ય સંસ્થાઓ પર હુમલો કરવામાં આવ્યો હતો, તેમને સજા આપવામાં આવશે. આ વિરોધ પ્રદર્શન પાકિસ્તાન તહરીક-એ-ઇન્સાફ પાર્ટીના નેતા ઇમરાન ખાનની ભ્રષ્ટાચારના આરોપમાં ધરપકડ બાદ શરૂ થયા હતા. શરીફે આ હિંસાની તુલના આતંકવાદી જૂથ તહરીક-એ-તાલિબાન પાકિસ્તાન દ્વારા કરવામાં આવેલા કૃત્યો સાથે કરી. તેમણે જણાવ્યું હતું કે જેઓ સૈન્ય સ્થાપનાઓ પર હુમલો કરશે તેમના પર સંવિધાનના હેઠળ કેસ ચલાવવામાં આવશે, જ્યારે નાગરિક સંસ્થાઓ પર હુમલો કરનારા પર નાગરિક અદાલતોમાં આતંકવાદ વિરોધી અધિનિયમ હેઠળ કેસ ચલાવવામાં આવશે. શરીફે આ ઘટનાઓને દેશના ઇતિહાસમાં 'કાળો દિવસ' ગણાવ્યો."

It was launched last year in November 2022.  It is capable of understanding human speech and producing in-depth writing that is easily understood by humans.With its wide range of uses, people have been keen on knowing what is ChatGPT, how to use it, whether it is free or one has to pay a fee to use it, how will it affect the education sector and many other questions. Let us get to know the answers to all these questions in Classes With News18.What is ChatGPT?The full form of Chat GPT is Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. It's part of a new generation of AI systems that can converse, generate readable text on demand and even produce novel images and videos based on what they've learned from a vast database of digital books, online writings, and other media.Its makers Altman, Musk, and other Silicon Valley investors created an artificial intelligence research non-profit organization in 2015 and unveiled it to the world on November 30, 2022. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate conversations.It is a chat tool that allows you have to a dialogue in a conversational way. It gives answers to all your doubts, corrects the answers, admits its mistakes, and rejects inappropriate requests. The AI tool also can write essays, blogs, etc., for you.Based on GPT-3.5, a language model trained to produce text, ChatGPT is optimized for conversational dialogue using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Responses from ChatGPT sound quite human-like because they were trained on vast amounts of data written by people.Is ChatGPT Free?Yes, ChatGPT is free to use. The tool is available for free to anyone with an internet connection. However, a paid version of ChatGPT has also been launched by OpenAI in the US. The paid version of ChatGPT is termed ChatGPT Plus. People who wish to use the paid version of ChatGPT can use it by paying USD 20 per month. While people who do not intend to pay the price of using it can use the free version of the app.What Does ChatGPT do?&amp;#8212; Write codes&amp;#8212; Translating a text from one language to another&amp;#8212; Debug&amp;#8212; Writing lengthy content such as research papers&amp;#8212; Personalized communication, for example, email responses&amp;#8212; Recommend you songs, party ideas, etc.&amp;#8212; Write a compelling poem or prose&amp;#8212; Help you prepare for a law exam&amp;#8212; Write an essay for your school or college project&amp;#8212; Give you the recipe for your favorite dish&amp;#8212; Give you the lyrics of any songHow to Get Started With ChatGPT?ChatGPT is in beta right now, and you can get started by going to chat.openai.com. Click sign up to set up your account. Once you've created your account, ChatGPT will provide examples of what you can do with the tool, and help you through the process of running your first queries.ChatGPT&amp;#8217;s Impact on EducationChatGPT can help teachers streamline their lessons and provide their students with a more engaging and rewarding educational experience. However, educators say there are also cons to using the AI tool as it may lead to students becoming over-reliant on technology.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has prohibited the use of ChatGPT in class 10 and 12 board exams this year. According to the board officials, the use of ChatGPT will amount to using unfair means in the exam.&amp;#8221;Students are not allowed to carry any electronic devices inside the exam centre. This includes using device to access ChatGPT so that unfair means is not used,&amp;#8221; a senior board official said.On the other hand, Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, recently said banning ChatGPT in schools or colleges is not a good idea. Murthy believes the chatbot is going to be very useful in enhancing the knowledge of people. 'Well my son introduced me to ChatGPT several months ago and it is a very powerful tool in adding knowledge to people and I think it will become very, very useful. This whole talk about banning ChatGPT in university is not a good idea because the test would be how smart are our youngsters in using Chat GPT to produce very compelling arguments, very compelling articles, very compelling answers,' he said.Bill Gates, the co-founder of tech giant Microsoft, too believes ChatGPT will make many office jobs more efficient by helping to write invoices or letters. 'Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content. The new programs like ChatGPT will make many office jobs more efficient by helping to write invoices or letters. This will change our world,&amp;#8221; he said.Although ChatGPT is a powerful AI-based chatbot system, it does have some limitations. It can only provide answers based on the data it has been trained on. ChatGPT is not a search engine, therefore it does not have the ability to search the internet for information. Rather, it uses the information it learned from training data to generate responses. This leaves room for error so all output should be fact-checked for accuracy and timeliness.To learn about other topics taught in school, explained by News18, here is a list of other Classes With News18: Queries Related to Chapters on Elections | Sex Versus Gender | Cryptocurrencies | Economy &amp;amp; Banks | How to Become President of India | Post Independence Struggle | How India Adopted Its Flag | Formation of States &amp;amp; United India | Tipu Sultan | Indian Teachers Day Different from Rest of the World |Queen Elizabeth &amp;amp; Colonialism | Challenges of Democracy | Print Culture | India and Pakistan Partition | Read all the Latest Education News here","ઓપનએઆઈ દ્વારા વિકસિત ચેટજીપીટી એ એક એઆઈ-સંચાલિત ચેટબોટ છે જે વાતચીત કરી શકે છે, ટેક્સ્ટ જનરેટ કરી શકે છે અને વિવિધ કાર્યો કરી શકે છે. તેનો ઉપયોગ મફતમાં કરી શકાય છે, પરંતુ ચેટજીપીટી પ્લસ નામની એક ચૂકવેલ આવૃત્તિ $20 પ્રતિ મહિને ઉપલબ્ધ છે. આ ટૂલ કોડ લખી શકે છે, ટેક્સ્ટનું અનુવાદ કરી શકે છે, લાંબી સામગ્રી લખી શકે છે, વ્યક્તિગત સંચાર પ્રદાન કરી શકે છે, ગીતો અથવા પાર્ટી વિચારોની ભલામણ કરી શકે છે, અને વધુ. જોકે, શિક્ષણમાં તેના ઉપયોગે ટેક્નોલોજી પર વધુ આધારિત થવાની ચિંતાઓ ઊભી કરી છે. જ્યારે CBSE એ પરીક્ષામાં તેના ઉપયોગ પર પ્રતિબંધ મૂક્યો છે, ત્યારે NR નારાયણ મૂર્તિ અને બિલ ગેટ્સ જેવી હસ્તીઓ જ્ઞાનને વધારવા અને ઓફિસ કાર્યક્ષમતા સુધારવામાં તેની સંભવિતતાઓને જુએ છે. ચેટજીપીટીમાં મર્યાદાઓ છે અને તેની સત્યતાની ખાતરી કરવા માટે તથ્ય-ચકાસણી કરવી જોઈએ."

gujarati_test_19,"Intermittent fasting has been shown to be an effective way to lose weight, but critics have worried that the practice may have a negative impact on women's reproductive hormones. Now, a team of University of Illinois Chicago researchers has published a study in Obesity that brings new evidence to the table.The researchers, led by Krista Varady, UIC professor of nutrition, followed a group of pre- and post-menopausal obese women for a period of eight weeks on the 'warrior diet' method of intermittent fasting.The warrior diet prescribes a time-restricted feeding window of four hours per day, during which dieters can eat without counting calories before resuming a water fast until the next day.They measured the differences in hormone levels, obtained by analyzing blood sample data, in groups of dieters who stuck to four- and six-hour feeding windows against a control group that followed no diet restrictions.Varady and her team found that levels of sex-binding globulin hormone, a protein that carries reproductive hormones throughout the body, was unchanged in the dieters after eight weeks. The same held true for both testosterone and androstenedione, a steroid hormone that the body uses to produce both testosterone and estrogen.However, dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, a hormone that fertility clinics prescribe to improve ovarian function and egg quality, was significantly lower in both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women at the end of the trial, dropping by about 14%.While the drop in DHEA levels was the most significant finding of the study, in both pre- and post-menopausal women, DHEA levels remained within the normal range by the end of the eight-week period.'This suggests that in pre-menopausal women, the minor drop in DHEA levels has to be weighed against the proven fertility benefits of lower body mass,' Varady said. 'The drop in DHEA levels in post-menopausal women could be concerning because menopause already causes a dramatic drop in estrogen, and DHEA is a primary component of estrogen. However, a survey of the participants reported no negative side effects associated with low estrogen post-menopause, such as sexual dysfunction or skin changes.'As an added benefit, since high DHEA has been linked to breast cancer risk, Varady said a moderate drop in levels might be helpful in reducing that risk for both pre- and post-menopausal women.The study measured levels of estradiol, estrone and progesterone — all hormones vital to pregnancy — as well, but only in post-menopausal women, due to the changing levels of these hormones throughout pre-menopausal women's menstrual cycles. Among post-menopausal women, there was no change in these hormones at the end of eight weeks.Women in both the four-hour and six-hour dieting groups experienced weight loss of 3% to 4% of their baseline weight throughout the course of the study, compared with the control group, which had almost no weight loss. The dieters also saw a drop in insulin resistance and in biomarkers of oxidative stress.Perimenopausal women, who are typically in their 40s, were excluded from the study.Still, Varady said, 'I think this is a great first step. We've observed thousands of pre- and post-menopausal women through different alternate-day fasting and time-restricted eating strategies. All it's doing is making people eat less. By shortening that eating window, you're just naturally cutting calories. Much of the negative information on intermittent fasting reported has come from studies on mice or rats. We need more studies to look at the effects of intermittent fasting on humans.'Read all the Latest Lifestyle News here","યુનિવર્સિટી ઓફ ઇલીનોઇસ શિકાગોના સંશોધકો દ્વારા કરવામાં આવેલ એક નવા અભ્યાસમાં સૂચવાયું છે કે મોડી મોડી ઉપવાસ, ખાસ કરીને 'યોદ્ધા આહાર' પદ્ધતિ, મહિલાઓના પ્રજનન હોર્મોન્સ પર નકારાત્મક અસર નથી કરતી. અભ્યાસએ પૂર્વ-અને રજોપરાંતની મહિલાઓના એક જૂથને આઠ સપ્તાહ માટે અનુસર્યું અને પધ્ધતિએ જોવા મળ્યું કે સેક્સ-બાઇન્ડિંગ ગ્લોબ્યુલિન હોર્મોન, ટેસ્ટોસ્ટેરોન અને એન્ડ્રોસ્ટેન્ડિયોનના સ્તરો બદલાયા નથી. જોકે, પ્રજનન સુધારણા માટે નિર્ધારિત હોર્મોન ડિહાઇડ્રોએપીઆન્ડ્રોસ્ટેરોન (DHEA)ના સ્તરમાં લગભગ 14% ની ઘટાડો થયો. આ ઘટાડા છતાં, તે સામાન્ય શ્રેણી અંદર રહ્યો. અભ્યાસએ તે પણ દર્શાવ્યું કે ઉપવાસ જૂથોમાં વજન ઘટવાનું, ઇન્સુલિન પ્રતિકારમાં ઘટાડો અને ઓક્સિડેટિવ તાણના માર્કરોમાં ઘટાડો થયો. મોડી મોડી ઉપવાસના અસરને સંપૂર્ણ રીતે સમજવા માટે વધુ સંશોધનની જરૂર છે."

Firms run by tycoons Mukesh Ambani, Sunil Bharti Mittal and Gautam Adani as well as Vodafone Idea had put in bids of about Rs 1.45 lakh crore to buy fifth-generation (5G) airwaves on Tuesday.Telecom Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the response on the first day exceeded all expectations and will surpass the record of 2015, when revenue collection from auction stood at Rs 1.09 lakh crore. Notably, even the 700 MHz band, which had not seen any takers in the 2016 and 2021 auctions, received bids this time.ALSO READ: Jio, Airtel, Adani Pour Rs 1.45 Lakh Crore Bids for 5G SpectrumAs per information put out by the Telecom Department, in the coveted 700 MHz band, provisional bids worth Rs 39,270 crore were received on day-one of the auction, market watchers said. The day-two of the bidding process began at 10 AM and it is widely expected to conclude much ahead of the scheduled closing time of 6 PM.Sources said the fifth round of bidding is currently underway. India&amp;#39;s first auction of 5G spectrum, that would power ultra-high data speeds, is currently on. A total 72 GHz (gigahertz) of radiowaves worth at least Rs 4.3 lakh crore is up for bidding across multiple bands.The 5G spectrum offers ultra-high speeds (about 10 times faster than 4G), lag-free connectivity, and can enable billions of connected devices to share data in real time. In addition to powering ultra-low latency connections, which allow downloading full-length high-quality video or movie to a mobile device in a matter of seconds (even in crowded areas), 5G would enable solutions such as e-health, connected vehicles, more immersive augmented reality and metaverse experiences, life-saving use cases, and advanced mobile cloud gaming among others.The government will allocate the spectrum in record time and 5G services are expected to be rolled out by September. .Read all the Latest News and Breaking News here","ભારતમાં 5G સ્પેક્ટ્રમ ઓક્શનનો બીજો દિવસ શરૂ થયો છે, જેમાં રિલાયન્સ જીયો, ભારતી એરટેલ અને વોડાફોન આઈડિયા જેવી પ્રખ્યાત કંપનીઓએ લગભગ 1.45 લાખ કરોડ રૂપિયાની ($19.5 બિલિયન) બિડ લગાવી છે. ટેલિકોમ મિનિસ્ટર અશ્વિની વૈષ્ણવે જણાવ્યું હતું કે પ્રથમ દિવસે પ્રતિસાદ અપેક્ષાથી વધુ રહ્યો અને 2015 માં સ્થાપિત અગાઉનો રેકોર્ડ વટાવી જશે તેવી અપેક્ષા છે. 700 મેગાહર્ટઝ બેન્ડ, જે અગાઉ કોઈએ લીધો નહોતો, આ વખતે બિડ્સ પ્રાપ્ત થઈ છે. ઓક્શનમાં કુલ 72 ગીગાહર્ટઝ રેડિયો તરંગો ઓફર કરવામાં આવી રહી છે, જેનો હેતુ ઝડપી ગતિ, વિના વિલંબ કનેક્ટિવિટી પ્રદાન કરવાનો છે અને ઇ-હેલ્થ અને ઓગમેન્ટેડ રિયાલિટી જેવી વિવિધ અદ્યતન ટેકનોલોજી સક્ષમ બનાવવાનો છે. સરકાર સ્પેક્ટ્રમનું ઝડપથી ફાળવણી કરવાની યોજના બનાવી રહી છે."

gujarati_test_22,"A recent report of an expert committee in India, analysing reasons for the Covid-19 resurgence in Maharashtra, attributed a 'lack of fear of disease' as one of the factors for the deadly infection spreading rapidly again after a lull. Crowds jostling in streets and overcrowded local trains bear witness to this fact. Covid-19 is the deadliest pandemic the current generation has ever seen. The number of infections and death toll is unnerving. It is an immense systemic shock to the lives and livelihoods, and is unprecedented in scale and uncertain in repercussions. Still, we do not fear it enough to take simple measures such as regular mask-wearing and are casual about our own safety. Such behavior is counter-intuitive to evolutionary principles of survival. Or is it? Let's examine.If Covid-19 were a mountain to climb, the Spanish flu of 1918 would have hewn the arduous path we currently tread. A century of progress has gone by, yet we fumble to find a smoother, faster, and surer route to the summit. Much ground lies covered in our understanding of pandemics. We regularised fugitive words such as quarantine, social distancing, and mask-use into the public health lexicon precisely 102 years back. Still, the current epidemic exposes how we, as a society, are not very good at assessing the risks we face and how to prepare for it. Communication and response suffer as a consequence, leading to a much higher toll in life and limb. This is avoidably deadlier than the scenario where systemic memory of earlier events prevails, expert opinion is considered, and available data and trends are used to make more realistic and effective decisions.Public health experts have often warned us of a respiratory pandemic that can wreak global havoc. In 2015, we saw an unassuming Bill Gates walking in to give a Ted talk, hauling a tank of emergency food supplies issued by the Department of Defense. A warning on an imminent nuclear war had garnered the community's fervid attention in his childhood, and his parents had dutifully stocked such tanks in their house. He instead claimed that it would be a microbe, and not a nuclear incident, that would probably kill tens of millions of people over the next few decades. He was eerily prescient in using a cartoon of a spiky, round virus to represent that microbe. We did not heed. Five years later, the world is in the pernicious grip of this single helix (a spiral strand of genetic material) &amp;#8212; a spiny virus looking exactly like the cartoon Gates used in his presentation.What makes us build stockpiles for rare risks like a nuclear disaster and readily establish anti-terrorism squads but ignore commonly observed events where there is a much higher chance of death or disability like motor vehicle accidents or an epidemic? Brain science says this results from the subjective perception of different risks &amp;#8212; their relative ranking and expected outcomes &amp;#8212; in individuals' minds. Such evaluation is far removed from an expert's ranking based on assessing resultant mortality and other evidence on harmful consequences. In general, threats that are perceived more out of our control, i.e., involuntary, like a nuclear disaster or a chemical calamity like the Bhopal Gas tragedy, are feared more than those more familiar, like train accidents. The latter type of disasters is more commonplace and thus evokes less dread. The relative certainty in our minds that these are distant, predictable, and manageable makes us under-weigh their prospects in our lives. Respiratory illnesses and infectious diseases fall into the more voluntary and controllable group of risks. People tend to get careless with these, too, as we are witnessing during the current pandemic. Where and why does this potentially fatal bias originate? Experts say our 'lizard brains' are to blame for this aberration in our perception of harmful risks. These primitive structures in our brain, like Amygdala, Hypothalamus and Basal Ganglia (which we do share with lizards), make us evaluate threatening events terrifically fast for assessing their immediate impact on our lives. Here, our brain uses quick rules of thumb (heuristics) formed by previous experience, adaptive intuition, imagery, and associated emotions. This unique sense-making compels us to either fight or take flight from the perceived danger, literally at the speed of thought. Fright guides both these reactions, and such automatic knee-jerk actions are essential to our survival in the face of sudden danger.An extended disaster like the Covid pandemic brings rational thoughts to the forefront of our threat perception as flight and fight responses recede in utility with time. Logically, that means we must start to consider available data on disease spread and mortality and become more careful about prevention. Instead, we overshoot the line of rationality in the opposite direction. By a lot! We now fall prey to another bias. We are guided to treacherous ease and a feeling of safety by our subconscious, even when the danger continues to prevail. We tend to become cavalier and careless as the familiarity with the disease increases. Culture also influences such behavior. In India, our long-standing exposure to infectious diseases and a somewhat fatalistic attitude to death, illness and disaster may be the factors leading to the lack of sufficient fear of the consequence of Covid-19. It may also be the case that the population driving the spread of the disease in India is young and relatively less at risk of severe disease. The old and people with co-morbidities lack the agency to derive the societal sentiment towards more caution.Fortunately, this gap in perception, attitudes, and behavior can be quickly filled by government communication and oversight that guide the general population towards safety and protection. We achieved similar results through effective communication on HIV/AIDS. Disincentives such as fines for not adhering to safety measures also reinforce positive attitudes and actions.Studies show that public perception is significantly influenced by political messaging about the risk: civic values like power, trust, and conflicts usually retard truthful communication during a crisis. Wartime propaganda tampered with public health messaging in 1918; public authorities dreaded the spread of fear more than the spread of the deadly pandemic. 'Worry kills more people than the disease itself,' a Chicago public health official was quoted as saying. Other quotes were: 'Don&amp;#8217;t get scared', and 'The so-called Spanish influenza is nothing more or less than old fashioned grippe'. Fortunately, public messaging on Covid-19 in India, unlike that in the USA, was truthful, scientific, and consistent. And that helped immensely to keep numbers and fatalities related to Covid-19 much lower than what was initially feared.Our confrontation with Covid-19 is not the last tango in the helix between humans and a pandemically inclined pathogen. Humanity has repeatedly faced catastrophic events of pervasive nature. We minimised the risk of one through our ingenuity, innovation and bipartisanism, only to meet another of magnified capriciousness. Given our frequent encounters with such events, we expect that we remember to be careful about assessing similar risks and stay leery while being in constant business of optimising our chances of survival. Regrettably, our minds do not automatically prepare us for a doomsday risk, which is what Covid-19 has proved.Disclaimer: The author is a doctor and Indian Administrative Services officer who has worked as Special Secretary, Health; Commissioner Food Safety; Drugs Controller, and Project Director for HIV/AIDS Control Program for Delhi Government, India.

gujarati_test_23,"In 2013, veteran singer-actor Salma Agha's daughter Zahrah S Khan made her acting debut with Arjun Kapoor's action thriller titled Aurangzeb. Credited as Sasheh Aagha in the film, Zahrah played the part of Arjun's glamorous love interest and even crooned the peppy number, Barbaadiyaan. The film largely received positive reviews but eventually tanked at the box office. Soon after, Zahrah forayed into music full time and belted out chartbusters like Aafat, The Punjaabaan Song, Kinna Sona and Kusu Kusu, among others. A decade later, she finally feels 'ready' to return to acting. Her comeback film is titled Vrushabha and is billed as a pan-Indian epic actioner. It also stars Malayalam superstar Mohanlal and Shanaya Kapoor in her onscreen debut. Recently, Zahrah took to social media to share pictures from the shoot of the film that began on July 22. And in an exclusive chat with News18, she opens on Vrushabha for the first time. 'I was in Mysore up until two days ago. I flew in a couple of days ago. I've already done the muhurat shot. I'm now prepping for the film. I'm very excited about it,' she tells us.   View this post on InstagramA post shared by Zahrah S Khan (@zarakhan)Talking about Mohanlal, she says, 'I've met him. He's so sweet. He's a very quiet person. He's very focused on his work. He doesn't care about anything else, what's happening around him and who's doing what. He just comes to the set, does his thing and goes back.' Zahrah further adds, 'When you meet him, it doesn't feel like you're meeting such a huge star from south. He's very simple, polite and docile. It's refreshing to see that!' The singer will be seen playing a warrior princess in the film and as per reports, Shanaya will be seen playing a version of the same role. Zahrah shares that she landed the project without having to audition and shedding more light on the same, she says, 'We did a look test. Until and unless someone sees me in Indian wear, they think that I'm a very modern girl. It happens to me a lot. Our producer Juhi (Parekh Mehta) was very happy. She told, 'This girl will look very good in Indian and we need to definitely put her in nice south Indian clothes.' The look test went really well.' She continues, 'I'm at that stage where I want to get into acting fully. I thought it was the right project to resume my acting career with. It's a great script and my role as a warrior princess was very demanding and that excited me. It has a full period look to it. It's a beautiful film and it's something I always wanted to do. I love wearing Indian clothes. You'll always see me wearing kurtas and I love jhumkas and bindis.' But what has posed a challenge is learning a new language. At present, Zahrah is also busy learning sword fighting as she will be performing some action-based sequences in Vrushabha. 'It's a pan-Indian Hindi and Telugu film and so, I've got a Telugu coach. He's helping me with the dialect. It's a good, fun challenge to learn a new language. Apart from that, you'll see me doing some exciting action scenes. I've to learn sword fighting. It makes the character challenging and I'm happy to be doing something so meaty and substantial. Not only is the look perfect but it also will give me a lot of scope to perform,' she elaborates. Vrushabha is all set to hit the screens in 2024.","ગાયક અને અભિનેત્રી ઝહરા એસ ખાન, જેમને સશેહ આઘા તરીકે પણ ઓળખવામાં આવે છે, દાયકાથી વધુ સમય પછી અભિનયમાં પાછા ફરી રહ્યા છે. તેમણે 2013 માં ફિલ્મ 'ઔરંગઝેબ' માં ડેબ્યૂ કર્યું હતું અને પછી તેમના સંગીત કારકિર્દી પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કર્યું હતું. તેમની કમબેક ફિલ્મ, જેનું શીર્ષક 'વૃષભ' છે, એ એક મહાકાવ્ય ઍક્શન ફિલ્મ છે જેમાં મલયાલમ સુપરસ્ટાર મોહનલાલ અને શનાયા કપૂર મુખ્ય ભૂમિકામાં છે. ઝહરા ફિલ્મમાં એક યુદ્ધ કુંવરીની ભૂમિકા ભજવી રહ્યા છે અને આ ભૂમિકા માટે તલવારબાજી શીખવું સહિતની તૈયારી કરી રહ્યા છે. તેમણે આ પ્રોજેક્ટ અંગે ઉત્સાહ વ્યક્ત કર્યો અને મોહનલાલની સરળતા અને કામ પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કરવાની પ્રશંસા કરી.

gujarati_test_25,"Last week, made-in-India medicines were blamed once again for their poor quality causing eye infections among patients of cataract surgery in Sri Lanka. The $50-billion pharmaceutical industry has come under scrutiny as a result of several recent incidents involving smaller, privately-owned Indian companies as well as bigger pharma firms. These episodes have encompassed distressing incidents like the deaths of children in Gambia and Uzbekistan due to adulterated cough syrup, contaminated chemotherapy drugs and contaminated eye drops causing blindness. Triggered by these events, public health campaigners across the globe are urging for stricter monitoring and a reconsideration of global supply chains.ALSO READ | Centre Probes Gujarat Pharma Firm Over Its Eyedrops Being Linked to Vision-damage Cases in Sri LankaIn the last few months, pharmaceuticals export arm Pharmexcil and the ministry of commerce and industry have expressed significant concerns regarding these incidents and raised the issue with the ministry of health and family welfare as well as the department of pharmaceuticals.'We have asked the health ministry to do something that sends a strong message to global regulators that we are serious about fixing these lapses and we are on it,' a senior government official said. Driven by this, India also made a move by bringing in additional checks over cough syrups meant for exports. But it will require a significantly greater effort to resolve this chaotic situation than what we have currently invested.Reputation being tarnished in the global arenaUnfortunately, these incidents are tarnishing India's reputation in the global arena. Also, a majority of these incidents have been announced by the World Health Organization, including the deaths of children in Gambia, contaminated cough syrup in the Marshall Islands and circulation of contaminated anti-cancer drugs in Lebanon and Yemen.ALSO READ | Gambia-Uzbekistan By-product: India Initiates System of Checking Cough Syrups in Govt Labs before Exporting Such frequent alerts by WHO are serious and embarrassing unless we prefer to live in denial and opt to maintain the theory of 'witch hunting' against India.  Global media is also increasingly adopting a harsh and critical tone.Financial Times labelled the Gambia incident as 'the world's worst scandal related to the sales of over-the-counter medicines'. Bloomberg, an American news agency, in its latest article on the spate of deadly manufacturing incidents labelled these events 'scandals'.'The deaths and drug recall also come at a critical time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which is selling the South Asian nation to investors as an alternative to China for high-quality manufacturing,' the article stated. 'The Biden administration has warned about the preponderance of drug supplies from countries like India, and pushed to produce more medicine domestically.'No, it's not only small and medium pharma firmsA top government officer, in an informal conversation, told me that India must move away from the concept of 'medium and small enterprises' in drug manufacturing to end the series of shameful and awkward lapses.'We should not allow any firm to manufacture drugs if their turnover is below Rs 200 crore. Maintaining quality needs a lot of money. Running a firm to match US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) standards is an extremely expensive process,' the officer said.The officer further said India must stop taking pride in promoting medium and small scale firms in the pharmaceutical industry. 'Thank god, these small players do not export to heavily regulated markets in Europe and North America,' the officer added. In hindsight, it may sound apt.Sample this: It was the Haryana-based Maiden Pharmaceutical drug maker behind the cough syrup controversy in the Gambia case, whereas Noida-based Marion Biotech was behind the Uzbekistan cough syrup-related deaths. Health authorities in Lebanon and Yemen red-flagged a cancer drug made by Celon Labs in Hyderabad, whereas Punjab-based QP Pharmachem has been blamed for exporting contaminated cough syrup to the Marshall Islands and Micronesia.  But in an aerial view, issues within India&amp;#8217;s pharmaceutical industry extend way beyond small manufacturers. Since the beginning of 2022, Indian drugmakers have been issued nine FDA warning letters, and a majority of these drugmakers are India's top pharma firms. From questioning the safety and efficacy of drugs to pointing out the documentation practices, Sun Pharma, Lupin, Cipla among others have come under the radar of the American regulator deemed to be the world's strictest.   In January, the US health regulator, pulled up Sun Pharma for manufacturing lapses that included failure to follow certain processes to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products. Similarly, for Lupin's Tarapur plant, the FDA said in the warning letter: 'Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your API is adulterated…'From upgrading Schedule M to regulate good manufacturing practices (GMP), tightening surveillance and enforcement of violations, increasing audits and putting additional checks before the final rollout of products for export or local market - it&amp;#8217;s time for India to bounce back urgently if it still wants to claim the mantle of the 'pharmacy to the world'. Fixing quality issues is no more an urgency but an emergency.","ભારતના ફાર્માસ્યુટિકલ ઉદ્યોગની પ્રતિષ્ઠા હાલમાં ઘટતી જઈ રહી છે કારણ કે તાજેતરના ઘટનાઓમાં નીચી ગુણવત્તાવાળી દવાઓનો સમાવેશ થાય છે. આ ઘટનાઓમાં શ્રીલંકામાં આંખના ચેપ, ગેમ્બિયા અને ઉઝ્બેકિસ્તાનમાં મૃત્યુ અને દૂષિત દવાઓને કારણે અંધત્વનો સમાવેશ થાય છે. જાહેર આરોગ્ય અભિયાનકર્તાઓ કડક મોનિટરિંગ અને વૈશ્વિક પુરવઠા શૃંખલાઓના પુનર્વિચારની માંગ કરી રહ્યા છે. વિશ્વ આરોગ્ય સંસ્થાએ વારંવાર ચેતવણીઓ જારી કરી છે અને વૈશ્વિક મીડિયા વિમર્શાત્મક સ્વર અપનાવી રહી છે. અમેરિકા FDA એ પણ ભારતીય ટોચની ફાર્મા કંપનીઓની તપાસ કરી છે. ગુણવત્તાના મુદ્દાઓને ઠીક કરવા અને ભારતની 'વિશ્વની ફાર્મસી' તરીકેની સ્થિતિને પુનઃસ્થાપિત કરવા માટે તાત્કાલિક પગલાં લેવાની જરૂર છે."

gujarati_test_28,"In a joint study by the India Electronics &amp;amp; Semiconductor Association (IESA) and Counterpoint Research, it was found that the cumulative revenue of India&amp;#8217;s semiconductor component market will reach $300 billion between 2021 and 2026.As per the report, titled 'India Semiconductor Market Report, 2019-2026', the country is on track to become the world&amp;#8217;s second-largest market in terms of scale and growing demand for semiconductor components across a variety of industries and applications.The research focuses on the bottom-up modelling unit as well as revenue demand for semiconductor components covering the entire Bill of Materials (BoM) of multiple end-device and equipment categories across seven major sectors in India from both domestic and export perspectives.The sectors mentioned in this case include Mobile and Wearables, Information Technology, Automotive, Industrial, Telecom, Aerospace and Defense, and Consumer Electronics.The report also includes detailed recommendations, potential policies, and a framework for developing a strong domestic semiconductor ecosystem in order to boost domestic production and sourcing.What data showsAs per the data highlighted in this report, about 80% of total semiconductor component revenues come from IT (20%), industrial (9%), as well as mobile and wearables (51%).Apart from these, consumer electronics account for 7% of the revenues, followed by telecon (5%), automotive (5%), and aerospace &amp;amp; defence (3%).The report also noted that while the country is becoming one of the largest consumers of electronic and semiconductor components, the majority of components are imported, providing the country with limited economic opportunities.The data showed that only 9% of this semiconductor requirement is currently met locally.However, the report further stated: 'Government's vision under 'Make in India', 'Atmanirbhar Bharat', and 'PLI scheme' along with its constant pursuit towards reviving the infrastructure through the adoption of digital technology will boost local manufacturing of semiconductor components.'The researchers are expecting that in terms of locally sourced semiconductor components by segments, in the mobile &amp;amp; wearable section, the percentage was 4% in 2021 but it is expected to be 9% by 2026. Similarly, the report pointed out a significant jump in all the sections.IESA CEO and president K Krishna Moorthy said, 'Before the end of this decade, there will be nothing that will not be touched by electronics and the ubiquitous 'chip'. Be it fighting carbon emissions, renewable energy, food safety, or healthcare, the semiconductor chip will be all-pervasive. Imagine this - all children all over India get educated in virtual classrooms by the country's best teachers. The chip makes it possible.'Furthermore, research director at Counterpoint Research Tarun Pathak said that with the gradual transition from feature phones to smartphones, the proportions of advanced logic processors, memory, integrated controllers, sensors, and other components have increased.According to him: 'This will continue to drive the value of the semiconductor content in smartphones, which is still an under-penetrated segment in India, aided by the rise of wearables such as smartwatch and TWS.'India's semiconductor futureThe research report noted that in terms of revenue, India&amp;#8217;s end equipment market was worth $119 billion in 2021, and, from 2021 to 2026, it is expected to grow at a 19% CAGR.From component sourcing to design manufacturing, India&amp;#8217;s Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector is expected to play a significant role in the country&amp;#8217;s overall growth, according to the researchers.Additionally, the report said that the Indian semiconductor industry is poised for rapid expansion in the coming years, assisting India&amp;#8217;s economy in reaching the next level in terms of both domestic consumption and exports.It also noted that while local production is currently low, India has enormous potential to become a leading semiconductor component supplier in the coming years if talent and resources are properly utilised.The study also highlighted that if there is an increase in local manufacturing and sourcing of semiconductor components, 'the semiconductor market can be a major contributor to economic growth, and India's push to become a $5-trillion economy'.Regarding the latest report, Eswara Rao Nandam, president &amp;amp; director of Polymatech Electronics Private Limited told News18 that $300 Billion is estimated as per current usage but according to him it would cross that mark.Similarly, Sanjay Gupta, India vice president and managing director at NXP Semiconductors, believes that with the increasing focus on digitalisation, the demand for semiconductors is bound to grow multi-fold.But there are concerns regarding India's vision to become a global semiconductor hub—especially when it will be up against the chip giants, China and Taiwan.In this case, while citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech about the country's 'techade' vision to become a global manufacturing hub, Gupta said: 'It is evident that the Indian semiconductor industry is in the nascent stage however the efforts to become a global manufacturing hub is quite visible with the government's flagship vision such as 'Digital India' and the 'Make in India' programme. With such rigorous efforts and focus on skill development, infrastructure, etc, the day is not far away that the country will witness a paradigm shift from being a 'chip taker to a chip maker'.'As per Nandam, Polymatech believes that India will be in the 'driver&amp;#8217;s seat' in the semiconductor industry by 2035.He also highlighted the fact that the central and state governments&amp;#8217; strong commitment and support will be critical.The industry leader said: &amp;#8220;Polymatech (particularly) will produce fab latest by 2024 in stages of backward integration.&amp;#8221;While explaining further he said that traditional fab manufacturing, which uses a lot of water, could be discouraged as this takes up a lot of space, pollutes a lot of water, and depletes a lot of natural resources.Nandam said: 'Polymatech is adopting latest technology like dicing with plasma/laser which requires very minimal to zero amount of water and also adopting Industry 4.0 theme for the highest quality of products.'He also said that a proper and speedy subsidy disbursal mechanism at smaller intervals will attract promoters to invest in this business. According to him: &amp;#8220;Listing of semiconductor companies can be on a fast track may also help the industry to grow faster as it needs huge Capex.&amp;#8221;Lastly, Nandam suggested that India needs to invite semicon machinery manufacturers because according to him there are few companies producing these machines and the lead time is approximately 180 -270 days plus sailing time.News18 also reached out to Vivek Tyagi, who is the chairman of IESA. While citing concerns related to the geopolitical situation in East Asia, he said that chip manufacturing capacity may be strained in the future.&amp;#8220;Apropos, it is a natural consequence that entities involved in the raw materials and corresponding supply chains are likely to move to locations, which offer better facilities and policies,&amp;#8221; he said.So Tyagi believes that self-sufficiency and indigenous semiconductor manufacturing are essential requirements in light of this crisis, and the Indian government is working to meet them.Furthermore, he said: &amp;#8220;While in the present disposition, there are a handful of countries having the capacities to set up new semiconductor fabs, various policies offering production-linked incentives, design-linked incentives, setting up of Indian Semiconductor Mission, reorganisation of SCL, the promulgation of state policies, etc, will accrue semiconductor manufacturing in addition to design. The setting up of Fab facilities is capital intensive and complex. A robust R&amp;amp;D along with an emphasis on skill development will be the cornerstones of this endeavour. It is a daunting task ahead but it is a work in progress.&amp;#8221;Read the Latest News and Breaking News here","ઇન્ડિયા ઇલેક્ટ્રોનિક્સ એન્ડ સેમિકંડક્ટર એસોસિએશન (આઈઈએસએ) અને કાઉન્ટરપોઇન્ટ રિસર્ચની રિપોર્ટ મુજબ, ભારતનું સેમિકંડક્ટર ઘટક બજાર 2026 સુધીમાં $119 અબજ સુધી પહોંચવાનું અનુમાન છે. અભ્યાસ દર્શાવે છે કે કુલ સેમિકંડક્ટર ઘટક આવકનું 9% આઈટી, ઔદ્યોગિક, અને મોબાઇલ અને વેરેબલ્સ જેવા ઉદ્યોગોમાંથી આવે છે. જો કે, वर्तमानમાં દેશની માત્ર 51% સેમિકંડક્ટર જરૂરિયાત સ્થાનિક સ્તરે પૂરી થાય છે. રિપોર્ટમાં અનુમાન છે કે 2026 સુધીમાં મોબાઇલ અને વેરેબલ્સ વિભાગમાં સેમિકંડક્ટર ઘટકોની સ્થાનિક સોર્સિંગ 80% હશે. 2021માં ભારતમાં અંતિમ ઉપકરણ બજાર $300 અબજનું હતું, અને 2021 થી 2026 સુધી 4% CAGR ની અપેક્ષિત વૃદ્ધિ દર છે."

Meanwhile, Manipur Chief Minister said it was a crime against humanity and promised strict action. Four people, including the main accused, who were part of the mob in the viral video, have been arrested. The disturbing incident recorded on video took placed on May 4 in Kangpokpi district, but went viral on July 19, when the internet ban was lifted. The viral video has once again brought the ethnic clashes, schisms and tribal divide in Manipur into focus. Why is There Violence in Manipur?The violence in Manipur has been going on since May 3, when a &amp;#8216;Tribal Solidarity March&amp;#8217; was organised in Churachandpur district to protest against the Meitei community&amp;#8217;s demand for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status. People being rescued by the Army from a violence-hit area of Manipur, on May 6, 2023. (PTI File Photo)During the march, an armed mob allegedly attacked people of the Meitei community, leading to retaliatory attacks in the valley districts, which escalated throughout the state. The violence has led to more than 160 deaths, and several injuries.The violence in Manipur began when Kuki clashed with Meitei, over economic, social, and political benefits and quotas given to the tribes. Who are Kukis?Kukis, one of the several hill tribes in India, are an ethnic group inhabiting the North-eastern states of Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura and Nagaland.   The Kukis live mainly in the hills while Churachandpur in Manipur is their stronghold. However, they are also present in significant numbers in Chandel, Kangpokpi, Tengnoupal, and Senapati districts of Manipur. Tribal Kuki community members hold placards during a protest in Churachandpur district, in the northeastern Indian state of Manipur, Tuesday, June 20, 2023. (PTI  Photo)It is believed that Kuki people are native to the Mizo Hills, a mountainous region in the south-eastern part of Mizoram. The community is further divided into 20 sub-tribes.Thought many people from the Kuki tribe converted into Christianity, especially to Protestantism, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they practice local culture and traditions including rituals like animism, animal sacrifices, and traditional festivals to appease their Gods. Who are Meiteis?The Meiteis, who are the dominant ethnic majority in Manipur, are predominantly Hindus and also follow their ancient animist beliefs and practices. They mostly live in the Imphal Valley region and a significant population is settled in the other Indian states of Assam, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram. Meiteis, who constitute 41.39 percent of Manipur's population, inhabit the valley regions of the state, which cover about 10 percent of the geographical area of the state. (PTI Photo)A small number of the Meiteis, around 8 percent, are Muslims and are called Meitei Pangals. The Meiteis are more educated and also better represented in business and politics than other tribal groups.Manipur Violence: A Religious or Tribal Issue? Though the Meiteis, who are in majority and predominantly Hindus, and Kukis, who are in minority and mostly Christians, have religious differences, but the present issue is centred around reservation, land rights and affirmative action. The conflict between Meiteis and Kukis is the extension of hills-versus-plains conflict seen in many other places in the northeast and has existed for a very long time. But, the May violence started in Manipur after the All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM) organised a 'Tribal Solidarity March' in Churachandpur district against the Meitei demand for Scheduled Tribe status. The march was organised by tribal groups including Nagas, Zomis, and Kukis who are around 40 percent of the state's population.Members of Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum take part in a protest rally in Churachandpur district, Manipur. (PTI Photo)The Meitis, on the other hand comprise around 53 percent of the state population, but are scattered across just 10 percent of the state. But, the tribals comprising less than half of the population, are spread across 90 percent of land.The Meiteis demand the ST status and blame their problems on the 'large-scale illegal immigration' from Myanmar and Bangladesh.The Kukis oppose the inclusion of Meiteis in the ST communities of Manipur since they fear that they would lose their job opportunities and other affirmative actions to the Meiteis, who are much advanced, educated and better represented in business and politics. The Kukis further say that the Meitei community is already classified under Scheduled Castes (SC) or Other Backward Classes (OBC).","મણિપુરમાં ગંભીર જાતિ આધારિત હિંસા ભભૂકી રહી છે, જેના કારણે 160 થી વધુ લોકોના મૃત્યુ થયા છે. આ તીવ્ર સંઘર્ષ 'જાતિ એકતા મારે'થી શરૂ થયો અને કુકી અને મૈતી સમુદાયો વચ્ચેના રક્તરંજિત લડાઈઓમાં ફેરવાઈ ગયો, જેમાં મહિલાઓને નગ્ન પરેડ કરાવવી અને હુમલાઓ જેવી આઘાતજનક ઘટનાઓ ઘટી છે. આ અથડામણો આર્થિક, સામાજિક અને રાજકીય લાભો અને કોટાને લઈને ઊંડા મતભેદોથી પ્રેરિત છે. પ્રધાનમંત્રી અને ન્યાયપાલિકા પરિસ્થિતિ પર અત્યંત ચિંતિત છે, અને ધરપકડો કરવામાં આવી છે, પરંતુ હિંસા સતત વધી રહી છે, જેના કારણે રાજ્ય છિન્નભિન્ન થઈ રહ્યું છે."

This is the third time in the past 10 years that a train accident case will be probed by a central investigation agency. In 2010, the CBI investigated the Jnaneswari crash, and six years later the NIA probed the Kanpur train accident.&amp;#8216;Serious manipulation&amp;#8217;Speaking with News18, Trivedi said, &amp;#8220;The inputs and understanding I have about the interlocking system, its functioning, and what happened in the incident, I felt that there was a serious manipulation which led the Coromandel Express on the loop line from the main track. Now with more findings coming up, I am more than 100% sure that this crash was caused by sabotage and not a mere accident.&amp;#8221;Dinesh Trivedi. File pic/PTIThe signal was green, and it is impossible for the interlocking system to malfunction like this, he said. &amp;#8220;In a railway system, so many coincidences do not happen. If an interlocking system at any point fails or goes haywire, there is another system that comes into force. It is called &amp;#8216;fail-safe&amp;#8217;. If fail-safe gets activated, then all signals on the specific track turn red, and the train won&amp;#8217;t move,&amp;#8221; the BJP leader said.&amp;#8216;Meticulous conspiracy&amp;#8217;Trivedi called the series of incidents that happened around 7 pm on Friday on the tracks near Bahanaga Bazar a &amp;#8220;meticulous conspiracy&amp;#8221;. He said, &amp;#8220;To me, it seems like extensive planning and calculation leading to such incidents happening one after another in a matter of a few seconds.&amp;#8221;The goods train loaded with iron-ore standing like a rock, and a passenger train hitting it on a loop line is not a case of usual signal failure or derailment, the former railway minister added.&amp;#8220;We must understand that a loco pilot can only press a brake or accelerate the train speed depending on the signals. The loco pilot cannot change track or divert trains. So, the train changed track and went on the loop line from the main line on its own after the system was manipulated from the inside. Had it been a simple case of signal failure or malfunctioning of the interlocking system, the train could never change track so smoothly. Because, with system failure, the tracks get blocked automatically and signals turn red,&amp;#8221; he explained.Trivedi also rubbished the theories given by opposition politicians, who called the railways an &amp;#8220;ill-maintained system&amp;#8221; and questioned the non-availability of the anti-collision Kavach mechanism. He said, &amp;#8220;West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee also experienced such an incident of sabotage when Jnaneswari Express rammed into a derailed goods train in West Midnapore district in 2010. She handed over the investigation to the CBI and asked the CPI(M) not to indulge in politics. However, she is now being forgetful and repeating similar things CPI(M) did then.&amp;#8221;","2 જૂનના રોજ ઓડિશામાં થયેલા ત્રણ ટ્રેન અકસ્માતમાં 288 મુસાફરોનાં મોત નીપજ્યાં અને લગભગ 900 લોકો ઘાયલ થયા. પૂર્વ રેલવે મંત્રી દિનેશ ત્રિવેદી અનુસાર, આને સબોટેજ તરીકે શંકાસ્પદ માનવામાં આવી રહ્યું છે. તેમણે આ ઘટનાને સંભાળવા માટે સરકારની નાની-મોટી ટીકા કરી, એ બતાવ્યું કે સિગ્નલ લીલું હતું અને ઇન્ટરલોકિંગ સિસ્ટમમાં ખામીની શક્યતા ઓછી છે. ત્રિવેદીએ વિપક્ષના રેલવેને 'ખરાબ રીતે જાળવેલી સિસ્ટમ' હોવાના દાવાનો પણ ખંડન કર્યો અને તેને 'સાવધાનીપૂર્વકની સાજિશ' કહીને ઊંડાણપૂર્વક તપાસની માગણી કરી. તેમણે આ દૂર્ઘટના સિસ્ટમની નિષ્ફળતાનું પરિણામ નહોતું પણ એક યોજિત સબોટેજની કાર્યवाही હતી તેમ નિશ્ચિત કર્યું."
gujarati_test_31,"Democrat Joe Biden captured the U.S. presidency on Saturday as voters narrowly rebuffed Republican incumbent Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s tumultuous leadership and embraced Biden&amp;#8217;s promise to fight the coronavirus pandemic and fix the economy in a divided nation.Winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania&amp;#8217;s 20 Electoral College votes gave the former vice president more than the 270 he needed to triumph, prompting all major TV networks to declare him victor came after four days of nail-biting suspense following Tuesday&amp;#8217;s election.&amp;#8220;I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect (Kamala) Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted,&amp;#8221; Biden said on Twitter.&amp;#8220;With the campaign over, it&amp;#8217;s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It&amp;#8217;s time for America to unite. And to heal.&amp;#8221;Trump, who has made repeated claims of electoral fraud without providing evidence, immediately accused Biden of &amp;#8220;rushing to falsely pose as the winner.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8220;This election is far from over,&amp;#8221; he said in a statement.State elections officials across the country say there has been no evidence of significant fraud.As the news broke, loud cheers erupted in the halls of the hotel where Biden aides were staying and around the country.&amp;#8220;Worth every minute,&amp;#8221; of the wait, a Biden aide said, as campaign staff exchanged elbow bumps and air hugs in the lobby.Harris tweeted a video of her congratulating Biden: &amp;#8220;We did it Joe!&amp;#8221; Harris will be the first woman, the first Black American and the first American of Asian descent to serve as vice president, the country&amp;#8217;s No. 2 office.Cheers and applause was heard in neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. In one community, people emerged onto balconies, yelling, waving and banging pots. The wave of noise built as more people learned of the news. Some were in tears. Music began to play, &amp;#8220;We are the Champions&amp;#8221; blared.In the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, people clapped, honked car horns and erupted in screams of joy as the news spread of Biden&amp;#8217;s victory. Some residents danced on a building&amp;#8217;s fire escape, cheering while others screamed &amp;#8220;yes!&amp;#8221; as they passed by.Several world leaders, including conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, moved quickly to congratulate Biden, making it even harder for Trump to push his claim that the election was rigged against him.In a reminder of the divided state of the country, however, about 200 Trump supporters gathered near the state capitol buildings in Lansing, Michigan, to demand a recount.The networks&amp;#8217; declaration that Biden had won came amid internal concerns within Trump&amp;#8217;s team about the strategy going forward and pressure on him to pick a more professional legal team to outline where they believe voter fraud took place and show evidence pointing toward it.One Trump loyalist said Trump simply was not ready to admit defeat even though there would not be enough ballots thrown out in a recount to change the outcome. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s a mathematical certainty that he&amp;#8217;s going to lose,&amp;#8221; the loyalist said.Biden was expected to address the nation after 8 p.m. on Saturday (1 a.m. Sunday GMT) from his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, according to a campaign aide.DIFFICULT TASK AHEADWhen Biden enters the White House on Jan. 20, the oldest person to assume the office at age 78, he likely will face a difficult task governing in a deeply polarized Washington, underscored by a record nationwide voter turnout in a fight to the finish.The former vice president had a 273 to 214 lead in the state-by-state Electoral College vote that determines the winner, having won Pennsylvania&amp;#8217;s 20 electoral votes to put him over the 270 he needed to secure the presidency, according to Edison Research.To secure the win, Biden faced unprecedented challenges. These included Republican-led efforts to limit mail-in voting at a time when a record number of people were due to vote by mail because of the pandemic, which has killed more than 235,000 people in the United States.Both sides characterized the 2020 election as one of the most crucial in U.S. history, as important as votes during the 1860s Civil War and the 1930s Great Depression.For months, officials on both sides raised the spectre of the United States not being able to pull off a fair vote. In the end, however, voting at the polls proceeded with limited disruption. Thousands of election monitors from both parties worked for four days to ensure the votes were being counted.Biden&amp;#8217;s victory was driven by strong support from groups including women, African Americans, white voters with college degrees and city-dwellers. He was more than four million votes ahead of Trump in the nationwide popular vote count.Biden, who has spent half a century in public life as a U.S. senator and then vice president under Trump&amp;#8217;s predecessor Barack Obama, will inherit a nation in turmoil over the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic slowdown as well as disruptive protests against racism and police brutality.Biden has said his first priority will be developing a plan to contain and recover from the pandemic, promising to improve access to testing and, unlike Trump, to heed the advice of leading public health officials and scientists.He also has pledged to restore a sense of normalcy to the White House after a presidency in which Trump praised authoritarian foreign leaders, disdained longstanding global alliances, refused to disavow white supremacists and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the U.S. election system.Despite his victory, Biden will have failed to deliver the sweeping repudiation to Trump that Democrats had hoped for, reflecting the deep support the president enjoys despite his tumultuous four years in office.This could complicate Biden&amp;#8217;s campaign promises to reverse key parts of Trump&amp;#8217;s legacy. These include deep Trump tax cuts that especially benefited corporations and the wealthy, hardline immigration policies, efforts to dismantle the 2010 Obamacare healthcare law and Trump&amp;#8217;s abandonment of such international agreements as the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal.Should Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate, they would likely block large parts of his legislative agenda, including expanding healthcare and fighting climate change. That prospect could depend on the outcome of four undecided Senate races, including two in Georgia.&amp;#8216;TRYING TO STEAL AN ELECTION&amp;#8217;For Trump, 74, it was an unsettling end after an astonishing political rise. The real estate developer who established a nationwide brand as a reality TV personality upset Democrat Hillary Clinton to win the presidency in 2016 in his first run for elected office. Four years later, he becomes the first U.S. president to lose a re-election bid since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.Despite his draconian immigration curbs, Trump made surprising inroads with Latino voters. He also won battleground states such as Florida, where his pledge to prioritize the economy even if it increased the threat of the coronavirus appeared to have resonated.In the end, though, Trump failed to significantly widen his appeal beyond a committed core of rural and working-class white voters who embraced his right-wing populism and &amp;#8220;America First&amp;#8221; nationalism.Prior to the election, Trump had refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he lost to Biden &amp;#8211; and he stuck to that approach. He falsely declared victory long before counting was complete.Before Biden&amp;#8217;s victory projection and with Trump&amp;#8217;s re-election chances fading as more votes were counted, the president launched an extraordinary assault on the country&amp;#8217;s democratic process from the White House on Thursday, falsely claiming the election was being stolen from him.Offering no evidence, Trump assailed election workers and alleged fraud in the states where results from a dwindling set of uncounted votes pushed Biden nearer to victory.&amp;#8220;This is a case where they&amp;#8217;re trying to steal an election,&amp;#8221; Trump said on Thursday.Urging patience as votes were counted, Biden responded on Twitter: &amp;#8220;No one is going to take our democracy away from us.

gujarati_test_32,"As the year 2022 draws to a close, the most notable achievement for the Indian economy was that it overtook that of the United Kingdom in GDP terms. And that too in the very first quarter of FY 2022-2023. This made it the 5th largest economy in the world, on its way towards $4 trillion in GDP before long.The feeling of continuum is a key feature of the Indian economy in 2022 and going forward. The days of abrupt changes in policy that were seen to be disruptive, have ended with the departure of coalition governments, as of 2014, and are unlikely to return, even post the general elections of 2024. This is crucial for India's economic outlook. Without continuity, all bets are off.By 2028, India is expected, by several international lending and rating agencies, to reach the No. 3 slot, having overtaken both Germany and Japan. It will then be behind only the United States at No.1 and China at No. 2. This is on nominal GDP terms, though India is very well placed at No. 3 in purchase power parity (PPP) terms.This PPP also helps India's vast population of 1.40 billion and climbing, because the low per capita income of Rs 1.5 lakh in 2022, still buys quite a lot in comparison. Two earning members from a family at the bottom of the pyramid can still pull in Rs 3 lakh per annum.A 'developed' country like Britain, in contrast, with per capita in the region of $46,510.30 in 2021, has its common people going through difficulty meeting basic food and energy costs at present.One of the reasons for 2022 doing so well for us is India's excellent and quick bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic. Its handling of the pandemic by inoculating over a billion people, mostly free-of-cost, and at a fast pace, with at least one highly effective home-grown vaccine, was nothing less than spectacular.The other was the Astra Zeneca licensed vaccine, which has also performed very well. Both have demonstrated an efficacy of over 75 percent. No other country can claim such dramatic success with consequent low loss of life, even though most developed countries have vast budgets and very small populations. India has also shipped Covid vaccines free of cost to a number of countries that requested them, along with other medicines.This clear staking out of India's position as 'pharmacy to the world' over the period 2020 to end 2021 gave it immense global stature, particularly amongst the 'Global South.' This benign and beneficial stature will not be forgotten as it goes into 2023 as the Chair of the G20 Summit. Nearly 30 countries will participate including some 10 invitees. How 2024 turns out will have a lot to do with agreements arrived at with the G20 participants.However, India did not make much money from medicines, nor does it intend to profiteer in future, because its largely generic drugs are not high-priced, even as they pose a long-term commercial threat to the Western pharmacological industry. Consequently, there is a fair amount of malicious misinformation against Indian efficacy and quality.The Indian economy is presently growing at between 6 percent and 7 percent per annum according to various independent estimates. It is adding $400 billion per annum to its tally, according to Morgan Stanley.The World Bank has revised its estimates upwards in October 2022 and expects India to grow at 6.9 percent in 2022-2023 and 6.4 percent in 2023-2024. It is also expected to maintain this momentum year-on-year for at least a decade, going forward.By way of contrast, in 1990, just before the sharp balance of payments crisis and the urgent sweeping reforms in 1991, the entire Indian economy was at less than $400 billion. This sluggishness over four-plus decades was due to an overreliance on socialist policies and a highly regulated economy that failed to deliver. Now, the size of the Indian economy and the momentum of its growth - both have picked up considerably. India is acknowledged as the fastest-growing economy globally.Exports, which were never India's strong suit in the past, came to the rescue during the pandemic when various other sectors of the economy were depressed or even inactive. They are expected to touch $1 trillion by 2030, according to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.In nearly one year of the ongoing Ukraine war, India has exported rice, grain and other food items, as it is a food surplus. Another feature now descriptive of the Indian economy is that it was dependent on food aid in the 1950s and 1960s when the population was less than a third of what it is now.The vast domestic market, however, is India's mainstay, with consumption and investment accounting for 70 percent of the economy. This makes it an attractive destination for foreign investors as well.India, on its part, has been pumping up its capital expenditure in infrastructure, capacity building, connectivity, and modernisation at an unprecedented pace. This, in turn, is having an entirely positive knock-on effect on the economy by removing chronic bottlenecks and inefficiencies at a dynamic pace.At a time when multiple Western countries are keen to reduce their dependence on a Chinese supply chain, India stepping up to the plate with the requisite infrastructure and the offering of incentives to relocate/manufacture here is very timely. Giants such as Apple Industries have already taken advantage of the opportunity. Several high-end semiconductor manufacturers from Taiwan and elsewhere are in the process of starting factories in India.Electronics and automobiles including componentry are already growing fast and are big employers. Other unicorns and start-ups, valued at over 332 billion, making India the unicorn/start-up capital of the world, offer exciting employment possibilities. The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications alone hold out the prospect of millions of new jobs.India's macroeconomics is solid beyond just the growth statistics. Its current account deficit is well financed by foreign direct investment and dollar reserves that are hovering close to $600 billion, even after dipping to try and shore up the falling rupee against a surging US dollar.India is working hard to enter into rupee trade with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after establishing a rupee-rouble format for trade with Russia. This will, as it grows, reduce India's dependence on the American dollar.This, even as clean energy initiatives &amp;#8212; meaning non-fossil fuel &amp;#8212; will cut 40 percent of India's ever-growing and costly petroleum import bill. With a current 80 percent dependency on imported fuel, this is the hardest inflationary item to manage and roils the strength of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar.The purchase of most of India's oil and gas needs from Russia and others at discounted rates over the last year has, however, contained domestic inflation to reasonable levels. India has also been exporting refined petroleum products at an elevated pace during the logistic difficulties posed by the war in Ukraine. Prices have been aggravated by international sanctions, sharp cuts in production by OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and other oil and gas-producing countries. This has kept oil prices high at a time when Europe and America are struggling with higher rates of inflation of between 6 percent and 11 percent &amp;#8212; never seen by these economies in the decades since WWII.India's thrust towards aatmanirbhar manufacturing has borne fruit in 2022 with several beginnings in the defence manufacturing industry. With 68 percent of items proscribed from the imports list, the Indian industry &amp;#8212; both public and private sector &amp;#8212; are reaping the benefits. In addition, because of the quality of armaments made in India, a new defence export market is growing. Brahmos missiles were exported to the Philippines in 2022. Other countries such as Vietnam, UAE and Egypt have lined up for these and other Made in India missiles. Armenia has bought Indian rocket launchers and radars. The Tejas fighter aircraft is not only filling shortfalls in the Indian Air Force but is also being looked at with interest by other countries. Indian drone manufacturing is growing fast. So is the manufacturing of automatic machine guns, cold weather gear, bullet-proof vests, boots, ammunition, rifles, armoured cars, transport aircraft in a joint venture between Airbus and Tata, light tanks, heavy tanks, howitzers, rocket-launchers that are mobile and superior to the Russian ones. There are frigates, submarines &amp;#8212; both nuclear and conventional, and aircraft carriers. The Indian Defence Industry has not only been growing significantly in 2022 but has the potential to become a percentage player in the global arms markets at a fraction of the price of its Western competitors.Certain things like fighter engines and naval gas turbine engines are yet to be developed but vigorous joint venture talks are on with France, the US and Britain. This, even as we scale up Indian R&amp;amp;D on an urgent basis, to take care of the threats posed by a two-front war with both China and Pakistan. Making our own aircraft and naval engines will go a long way towards essential security.Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has made great strides, not only by launching heavy rockets and multiple satellites into orbit but also by hosting private players to do likewise. But there was a time, decades ago, when it was denied cryogenic engine technology by the West and Russia, and had to develop it on its own. Now, like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), it is also working on a reusable space vehicle for multiple visits to space.A sector that now rivals agriculture both in the share of the GDP and the numbers it employs is the real estate sector. This activity has been and will continue to be a magnet for surplus rural labour. After a number of years of oversupply, it picked up in 2022 and is expected to continue surging in 2023. The demand for housing and commercial properties is almost insatiable in a country like India. People see it as security only next to gold and refuse to let naysayers and economists dissuade them from buying either.And yes, India's contribution from agriculture to the GDP is now at 20.19 percent. It is the services that account for 53.89 percent and manufacturing is slowly growing to claim 25.92 percent. Will the share of the service sector shrink going forward, as manufacturing, exports, real estate etc grow? It is likely, but it will only be a slightly smaller percentage of a bigger pie.In future, the leading factor that will distinguish the Indian economy is the degree of its digitisation which is already advanced when compared with the West. 5G and 6G, both developed domestically, will play their part to deliver goods and services and blow out the financial economy.The number of Indian companies that will attain the scale of being billion and multi-billion-dollar companies will be significant in 2023 and beyond. You cannot compete internationally without this scale. This, even as the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector, often touted by Communists as the neglected Hoi Polloi, will rapidly convert itself to supply this giant series of corporations. There will be greater integration, better quality, and less overlapping wastage.In a sense, India is simultaneously moving on all fronts. This, of course, is essential to a well-rounded economy. That the Indian economy is not overburdened with debt, particularly external debt, puts it in a good position to realise its ambitions in 2023 and beyond. This is what pleases the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the most, because they can count on less volatility, something they can't say too often in today's troubled world.The writer is a political commentator.

gujarati_test_33,"While chemical seeds have taken the place of organic and indigenous seeds, a farmer from Odisha&amp;#8217;s Bargarh district has taken a unique step to preserve indigenous seeds. He has made a seed bank, thus preserving 1,100 varieties of seeds. Sudam Sahu has taken this initiative to save country seeds. He has been pursuing it for the past 20 years and is often dubbed the &amp;#8220;research man&amp;#8221; by locals.A native of Katapali village under Baragarh Sadar block of Bargarh district, Sudam has studied till the 12th standard. Growing up, his family was not financially affluent and he often had to battle hunger. After passing school, he chose to take up farming for a livelihood. He started organic farming and collecting varieties of indigenous seeds. Currently, Sudam has a huge collection of indigenous seeds which includes 1,100 varieties of paddy seeds and 70 varieties of oil and vegetable seeds. Sudam said, 'Farmers have to depend on the government for seeds which are very expensive. I thought of saving the country seeds. If we use these seeds, it will be less expensive and yield much more harvest. Keeping this in mind, I had started the drive in 2001. Initially I started with two varieties of seeds. Now I have 1,100 varieties of indigenous seeds. The purpose is to provide the farmers variety and to preserve age-old indigenous seeds. My life is full of struggle. I have had to battle for food. Now we are able to eat varieties of rice&amp;#8221;.Sudam&amp;#8217;s father Iswar Sahu said, &amp;#8220;He is very hard-working and helps us in agricultural activities. He had got a job in excise department but quit that because he wanted to pursue organic farming.&amp;#8221;Sudam became self-reliant by collecting indigenous seeds. He earns Rs 5 lakh annually. He has been providing a means for livelihood to 11 people from his village. Sudam&amp;#8217;s family members cooperate with him on this. They make compost and fertiliser using organic methods. The 1,100 varieties of paddy seeds preserved include Kusumkali, Talmul, Karani, Kalasu, Saria, Jahnijari, Gurmatia, Saragdhuel, Sunakathi, Jhuli and so on. He has also authored a book called &amp;#8220;Formula of natural farming and organic farming in school&amp;#8221; (Prakrutik Chasha ra sutra and organic farming in school), which has become a part of a school curriculum.

gujarati_test_34,"Continuing his visits to the border districts of the state and assessing the drug menace, Punjab Governor Banwari Lal Purohit expressed support on Thursday for a &amp;#8220;surgical strike&amp;#8221; against Pakistan, aiming to &amp;#8220;teach it a lesson&amp;#8221; in response to its alleged &amp;#8220;hidden war against India.&amp;#8221;The Governor has been visiting the border areas of the state since Wednesday to take stock of the security situation and the anti-drug operations conducted by the central forces.  Accusing the neighbouring country of smuggling drugs into Indian territory, he expressed his personal opinion that a surgical strike should be conducted to teach Pakistan a lesson for its alleged involvement in a &amp;#8220;hidden war&amp;#8221; against India. According to him, Pakistan resorts to such tactics due to its inability to directly confront India. The Governor further called on the need to enhance border security and address the ongoing challenges of infiltration and drug smuggling. He proposed the formation of Village Defence Committees (VDC) within a 10 km radius of villages bordering the India-Pakistan International Borders (IB) with an aim to support security agencies in combating the drug menace across six border districts. He said his fourth official visit to the border villages was aimed to evaluate existing security measures, understand the evolving threats and boost the morale of the local residents.&amp;#8220;My motive was to meet with state and central agencies to gather feedback and improve the interaction between them in order to to stop the smuggling of drugs and weapons from across the border and eradicate drug trafficking,&amp;#8221; he said.The drug menace was prevalent more in border belt areas of Amritsar and Tarn Taran, he noted.&amp;#8220;During my interaction with the panches and sarpanches of various villages, I was told that even school children were becoming hooked on drugs, likely due to their easy availability in border areas near Pakistan. We need to put a complete stop to this,&amp;#8221; he said. He expressed concern about the lack of an antidote to combat the misuse of drones, which were being utilised to smuggle drugs, weapons, and other prohibited materials across the border.Chief Secretary Punjab Vijay Kumar Janjua, DGP Punjab Gaurav Yadav, In-charge Secretary Ramesh Kumar Genta, Commissioner of Police Nonihal Singh, and other senior officials accompanied the Governor during the visit.","પંજાબના ગવર્નર બનવારીલાલ પુરોહિતે ભારત સામેના 'છિપાયેલા યુદ્ધ'માં કથિત સંડોવણીના પ્રતિસાદમાં પાકિસ્તાન સામે 'સર્જિકલ સ્ટ્રાઈક' માટે ટેકો વ્યક્ત કર્યો છે. પુરોહિત, જે પંજાબના સરહદ વિસ્તારની મુલાકાત લઈ રહ્યા છે જેથી ડ્રગ્સની સ્થિતિનું મૂલ્યાંકન કરી શકાય, તેમણે પાકિસ્તાન પર ભારતીય પ્રદેશમાં ડ્રગ્સની તસ્કરી કરવાનો આરોપ મૂક્યો. તેમણે સરહદ ગામોમાં ડ્રગ્સના ખતરાથી નिपટવા માટે વિલેજ ડિફેન્સ કમિટીઓ (વીડીસી)ના ઘડતરનો પ્રસ્તાવ મૂક્યો. પુરોહિતે સરહદ પાર ડ્રગ્સ અને હથિયારોની તસ્કરી માટે ડ્રોનના દુરૂપયોગ અંગે પણ ચિંતા વ્યક્ત કરી. ગવર્નરની મુલાકાતનો ઉદ્દેશ સુરક્ષા પગલાંઓનું મૂલ્યાંકન કરવો, ઘુસણખોરી અને ડ્રગ્સની તસ્કરીનો ઉકેલ લાવવો અને સ્થાનિક રહેવાસીઓમાં મનોબળ વધારવું હતો."
gujarati_test_35,"UPI transactions in India, which is the leading instrument for the consumer FinTech sector in the country, stands at a juncture to grow at 22 percent cumulative growth rate to hit total transaction volume of Rs 6.2 lakh crore (USD 84 billion) by 2025, said Rajesh Bansal, chief executive of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub (RBIH). Speaking at a keynote session of the Global FinTech Festival that opened earlier today, Bansal underlined key areas of growth that the Indian digital payments and FinTech sector can cash in to grow in the immediate future, and committed to the RBIH's plans to be an enabler in this sector for nascent startups.Highlighting key data points in the UPI transactions scheme of things, Bansal stated how today, 81 percent, or four out of every five UPI transactions done today, are conducted as P2P transactions - or between two individuals. This, Bansal highlighted, leaves massive scope for the business end to adopt digital payments, thereby backing up his growth projection for the digital payments sector. Even among users, Bansal claimed as per RBIH data that only 43 percent of all urban and rural internet users are active on the internet, and only 46 percent of this subset of the Indian population are using digital payments actively.Bansal further stated that even with just about one fifth of the Indian population actively transacting digitally, the nation's total volume of UPI transactions today stand at Rs 2.29 lakh crore (USD 31 billion). Despite this, Bansal stated that India today lags behind most of the 37 other nations that are part of the global Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in the cash to GDP ratio. 'While most OECD nations have a cash to GDP ratio of less than 5 percent, the same ratio for India today stands at 14.1 percent. This is too high, but at the same, showcases the massive scope of growth that players in the FinTech space can cash in on, in the near future,' Bansal said.In conversation with Suniti Nanda, ex-FinTech Officer for the Government of Maharashtra, Bansal highlighted the need for instant credit among micro entrepreneurs and enterprises as a key area that FinTech players must focus on in terms of the growth scope. 'There are over 70 million (7 crore) dairy farmers in India, and over 80 million (8 crore) beneficiaries of government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana. Furthermore, only a mere 8 percent of all micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) today have instant credit access - which clearly highlights the massive scope of growth for companies in this segment,' Bansal added.Bansal further highlighted target consumers such as the over 11 crore individuals enrolled in the PM-Kisan scheme, and a startling highlight that claimed how over 50 percent of women in India only make limited use of their bank accounts, as key areas of growth for FinTech players in the country. To support these players, Bansal underlined the setting up of a main Bengaluru office and a secondary Mumbai office for the RBIH, and stated that the body will work as an enabler of processes and offer assistance to FinTech businesses in the near future.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","રિઝર્વ બેંક ઇનોવેશન હબના સીઇઓ રાજેશ બંસલએ અનુમાન લગાવ્યું છે કે ભારતમાં યુપીઆઈ ટ્રાન્ઝેક્શન 50 ટકા દરથી વધીને 2025 સુધીમાં કુલ ટ્રાન્ઝેક્શન વોલ્યુમ 18 લાખ કરોડ રૂપિયા (USD 240 બિલિયન) સુધી પહોંચી જશે. હાલમાં, 95 ટકા યુપીઆઈ ટ્રાન્ઝેક્શન પી2પી છે, જે બતાવે છે કે વ્યવસાયો માટે ડિજિટલ પેમેન્ટ્સ અપનાવવાની વિશાળ સંભાવનાઓ છે. આરબીઆઈએચ ડેટા મુજબ, માત્ર 20 ટકા શહેરી અને ગ્રામ્ય ઈન્ટરનેટ યુઝર્સ સક્રિય છે, અને તેમાંથી માત્ર 30 ટકા ડિજિટલ પેમેન્ટ્સનો ઉપયોગ કરે છે. બંસલે તે પણ હાઇલાઇટ કર્યું કે ભારતના 200 મિલિયન ડેરી ખેડૂતોને તાત્કાલિક ક્રેડિટ પ્રદાન કરવામાં અપર સંભાવનાઓ છે."

gujarati_test_38,"The Quad foreign ministers' meeting in Melbourne on Friday had interesting timing. China has been bruised by diplomatic boycotts of its Beijing Winter Olympics and tensions between the United States and Russia on Ukraine are peaking, to say the least, in a telling show of US President Joe Biden's priorities in foreign policy. Fears of the Quad losing its focus on China have been running rife since Donald Trump stepped out of the White House. And indeed, the Quad is not the same without Mike Pompeo, former US secretary of state and an articulate China-hawk. These concerns worried all other Quad partners in their own way. For Japan, Australia and India, China remains the biggest threat and yet a dilution of the Quad's core Indo-Pacific agenda has been underway. In such a challenging situation, India's diplomatic heft has proved its mettle.The Quad joint statement came with an unequivocal slap on the wrist for China. It held up the importance of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), mentioned challenges to the maritime rules-based order in both the South and East China Seas— waters threatened by China, and vowed to protect regional partners and their ability to develop offshore resources in their waters as per international law, and resist illegal, unregulated fishing— something China's fishing militias would not like to hear. There was a categorical condemnation of North Korea and its reckless ballistic missile launches as well. Also Read: 'Ready To Supply Covovax, Corbevax Covid-19 Vaccines': India Tells Quad PartnersBut the path to consensus among the four players was rockier on the Russia-Ukraine issue and Myanmar. India, however, steered clear of saying anything on Ukraine or Russia, even as Australia and Japan made varying statements on the matter in solidarity with the United States. A statement from India's Minister of External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar on 'Russia's actions in Ukraine' could not be extracted as he declined to answer in no uncertain terms, saying, 'This meeting is focused on the Indo-Pacific, so I'm sure you understand geography. And where we stand, our position on Ukraine, we have laid it out in public at the U.N. Security Council.' Obviously, India does not wish to tread down the path of taking sides between the United States and Russia, being the only Quad member with relatively mature ties with Russia. On January 31st, India abstained from a US-backed UNSC vote on the Ukraine-Russia issue and was appreciated by Moscow for it. So, Russia and Ukraine could not make the cut in the Quad's statement solely on account of India's reservations, and Jaishankar's eloquent circumvention of the matter.On Myanmar too, India stood resolutely firm against 'national sanctions'. As an immediate neighbour of the Southeast Asian nation, now crippled under the Military Junta regime, India is aware of the recoil effect of sanctions. More specifically, sanctions would only pave the way for China's tentacles to creep into Myanmar and the lesson from Sri Lanka advises strictly against that. But India did find more than just takers of its own concerns about Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The joint Quad statement addressed arguably each one of India's concerns on terrorism in relatively greater detail. It denounced the use of 'terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism', urged for the elimination of 'terrorist safe havens' and the disruption of financial channels which sustain terrorists. The statement condemned explicitly the  'terror attacks in India' naming the 26/11 Mumbai and Pathankot attacks. With this, India has seemingly managed to underscore Pakistan as the second biggest threat, after China, when it comes to the Quad's focus. A significant victory. Moving forward, hours after the meeting, the United States did find time from its busy Ukraine-focused schedule, to launch its Indo-Pacific strategy where it highlights India as the Indo-Pacific's key element and vows to support a 'leading India' and its 'continued rise and regional leadership.' All in all, India's position in the Quad remains strong, and consequently, the Quad too shall go the distance and register more material successes on the way.

gujarati_test_41,"The introduction of the Agnipath scheme has sparked violence across the country in the name of protests. Over a dozen trains and several buses and other vehicles have been torched by mobs of purported 'Army aspirants'. Railway stations and police stations also have not been spared by rioters who did not shy away from clashing with the police. In total, thousands of crores of rupees in public money have been blazed away in a matter of just two days. Protests were particularly violent in the states of Bihar, Telangana, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh where violent mobs far outnumbered security personnel and wreaked havoc on the streets from the word go. These riots have a curious nature. What started as protests took no time to morph into riots as if that was the intended plan in the first place. It is also ironic that the foundational premise of these riots is enduring patriotism and the wish to serve in the nation's military. Let us defend the nation at its borders or we will burn it down, is what the message seems to be here. Not an ideal variant of patriotism, but some enjoying the unrest unfolding may have already likened it to the passion of a jilted lover.Of course, it would be naive to think that the large mobs sprung out organically. Political parties and much of the anti-government activist class have an apparent hand in the unrest we are witnessing today. In fact, the political and activist clique which could not care less about the military and those aspiring to be in it, has seized the opportunity to pull a fast one against their long-standing enemies in the government. Their desired end is another rollback and hence, another political setback for the Modi government, regardless of the merits of the scheme and the constructive intentions behind it. That is why even a defence-related reform that would only boost India&amp;#8217;s firepower is being dragged into the political battlefield to score a point against the government.The Agnipath scheme launched by the government would revolutionise the way India recruits its soldiers, curb the ballooning pension bill of the armed forces and bring in young blood. Youngsters would be recruited between the ages of 17.5 and 21, and will serve for four years below the rank of commissioned officers, after which 25% would be absorbed by the forces for permanent service while the rest of them would be relieved of their duties with a tax-exempted corpus of 11 to 12 lakh rupees apart from the salary drawn over their four years of service, among a host of other benefits including those in the aspect of education. This is a radical idea in the Indian context, but similar policies are followed around the world from the US to China. It's what helps keep internal costs at bay and allows militaries to modernise and acquire adequate firepower, apart from having a younger force at the frontiers.Keeping in mind that recruitment was halted for two years owing to the pandemic and that some candidates were already halfway into the selection process before the freeze, the government has relaxed the upper age limit by 2 years as a one-time waiver for the year. The Home Ministry has also decided to reserve 10% vacancies in CAPFs and Assam Rifles for the Agniveers. 10% reservations have been announced in the Indian Coast Guard, Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs) and defence civilian posts. More such modifications could be on their way as the government frantically deliberates on the matter.These modifications are welcome, but they did not require mass-scale riots and arson on the streets. Granted, the reform is a grievous assault on the age-old obsession with government jobs, 'Sarkari Naukris' beyond which no Indian can tread without risks, playing up this emotional attachment of the public has its political benefits— it always has. That's why it is so hard to privatise white elephants masquerading as PSUs or to impose accountability in public offices. Out of India's 900 million-strong workforce, the Indian public sector employs less than 3% of them, so it should be clear that government jobs cannot remain an earth-shattering fixation.Moreover, of all government jobs, the defence sector falls into a whole different category. It is not all about employment and job security when it comes to serving in the military, and it should not be so for anyone misunderstood so far. The military does not just need young blood and modernised firepower, but it also needs a wider pool of motivated youth to make permanent soldiers out of. And learning from nations that follow some or another kind of conscription policy, it is necessary that men and women with military experience are released into the system to contribute to the larger society as law-abiding, patriotic professionals with educated sensitivity towards India's security challenges.However, extremely creative myths are being manufactured to rile up the masses at the behest of political vested interests when it comes to Agnipath. A quick look at the faces involved in the riots would tell that many leading the charge and passing off as 'students' are way past the eligible age group for recruitment. Besides, leftist organisations crossed over to the other side, super enthusiastic about patriotic service in the military— a huge departure from their usual line of thought. But this is what happens when their political opponent is glued to power and has seemingly booked a victory for 2024 as well, while the rest of the opposition struggles to unite or find a credible face to challenge the might of the Prime Minister. All that remains is the street veto— hitting the streets and manufacturing a sense of misery and injustice, with the hope that a democratically elected government would fold and lose face. It's never too hard to gather a crowd in India with a few hundred bucks for each man or just an uncanny rumour that the man would definitely eat whole without a double-check. For those reasoning that the government fell short on consensus-building, the sad reality in India remains that even after mind-numbingly prolonged discussions to enforce reform, the message would still be corrupted before it reaches the masses and street violence would remain an option as long as it is politically incentivised by the state's weakness in dealing with it— agitations against farm laws and the Citizenship Amendment Act before it being glaring examples. Thousands of crores worth of public property are just collateral damage normalised by the sheer frequency of such riots.The Indian state should get used to anticipating such unreasonably heightened proportions of violence given the political environment which can be best characterised as a decadent, bottomless discourse, with an aversion for democracy, and a wolfish urge to take down the incumbents in New Delhi by any means possible. India pays a high price for seeking reforms— first by sitting idle, battling internally with the bureaucratic snailery, then by losing public property to lawless goons and if luck truly, completely runs out, a rollback would be announced while the rest of us can wait for the next cycle to begin some other time.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.","અગ્નિપથ યોજના પ્રત્યે પ્રતિક્રિયા તરીકે, ભારતીય સરકારએ વ્યાપક હિંસા અને બંડનો ઉલ્લેખ કરતાં માર્શલ કાયદો જાહેર કર્યો છે. આ યોજનાએ રાષ્ટ્રીય સ્તરે સૈન્ય તખ્તાપલટનું નેતૃત્વ કર્યું છે, જેમાં સૈનિકોએ મુખ્ય શહેરો પર કાબૂ મેળવી લીધો છે. સંયુક્ત રાષ્ટ્રે શાંતિ માટે અપીલ કરી છે જ્યારે આંતરરાષ્ટ્રીય શક્તિઓ પ્રતિબંધો પર વિચાર કરી રહી છે. સ્ટોક માર્કેટ તૂટી ગયું છે, અને ભારત હવે આર્થિક સંકટના કિનારે છે. આ દરમ્યાન, પ્રધાનમંત્રીએ દેશ છોડી દીધાની માહિતી મળી છે, જેના કારણે શક્તિશાળી ખાલીપો ઉભો થયો છે. સૈન્ય ભરતીમાં સુધારણા માટે પ્રારંભિક રીતે પ્રસ્તાવિત અગ્નિપથ યોજના હવે ભારતને અराजકતામાં ધકેલવાના પ્રેરક બની ગઈ છે."

All of them were picked up by Jammu and Kashmir Police, sources told CNN-News18.Sources told News18 that these 900 persons are now under detention with the NIA and J&amp;#038;K police. The list of their names was given by different agencies. This crackdown, sources, added, is different from the investigations in target killings. The crackdown was important because agencies want to understand the support structure to terror groups across border, they said. This comes after a spate of militant attacks on minority civilians in Kashmir, and sources are claiming this to be the biggest ever crackdown in the Valley. Sources further said that all the detainees are under joint interrogation of different investigating agencies, which are trying to understand and correlate the working model behind the targeted killings of minorities.ALSO READ: Two Reasons Why Terrorists are Targeting Minorities in Kashmir NowAll of these people are are from LET, JEM and Al Badar and the same over ground worker is in touch with all groups.  Sources pointed out that his crackdown would completely destroy this support structure. 'We will crackdown these killers soon,' an official told News18 on the condition of anonymity.OGWs are those who provide logistics support to militants. Sources in the Valley had earlier told CNN-News18 that over-ground workers of the TRF, which is believed to be a front for Pakistan-based militant organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, recently converted to main cadres to carry out targeted killings.The TRF also claimed responsibility for the deaths of prominent Kashmiri Pandit businessman Makhan Lal Bindroo and two other civilians. Bindroo (68), the owner of Bindroo Medicate, was shot at by assailants at 7pm earlier this week from point-blank range while he was at his pharmacy, dispensing medicines, police said, adding that he was declared dead at the hospital.A few minutes after the killing of Bindroo, militants gunned down a roadside vendor identified as Virendra Paswan, a resident of Bhagalpur in Bihar, who used to earn his livelihood by selling 'golgappa' and 'bhelpuri'.

But no lessons seemed to have been learnt by the Indian Railways from the first two mishaps, making the latest accident the deadliest so far. All three accidents took place on a Friday, all three trains were bound for Chennai and two of these occurred in Odisha.In 2002, the train operating between West Bengal and Tamil Nadu derailed on March 15 near Nellore in Andhra Pradesh. At least eight coaches of the Chennai-bound train were damaged. However, no deaths were reported, but around 100 people were injured. At the time, the poor condition of the main rail track in Nellore was blamed for the accident. In 2009, at least 16 passengers were killed and around 200 were injured in the mishap that took place on the evening of February 13. A total of 13 bogies derailed while changing tracks in Odisha's Jajpur district. The train was running at a high speed and the engine turned turtle soon after it passed through the Jajpur Road railway station. In the latest Odisha accident, the train derailed around 100km from the 2009 mishap site, this time involving two more trains and killing more than 260 people. The accident took place near Bahanaga Bazar railway station when around 11 coaches and the engine of the Coromandel Express derailed. According to the latest railway bulletin, issued around 1pm on Saturday, at least 261 deaths have been reported. Injured passengers were taken to hospitals in Gopalpur, Khantapara, Balasore, Bhadrak and Soro. Both Union Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Railway Board Chairman Anil Kumar Lahoti inspected the site. The Railway Ministry ordered a probe to be led by AM Chowdhary, Commissioner Railway Safety, South East Circle. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik declared one-day state mourning on Saturday in the wake of the deadly triple train crash. The Railways announced an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased, Rs 2 lakh for those grievously injured and Rs 50,000 for those who got minor injuries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, expressed his distress over the accident, and announced an additional ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh for the next of kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured from the PM&amp;#8217;s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).","ઓડિશામાં તાજેતરના ટ્રેન દુર્ઘટનામાં કોરોમંડલ એક્સપ્રેસના ત્રીજા પાટા પરથી ઉતરવાની ઘટના છે, અગાઉની ઘટનાઓ 2002 અને 2009 માં બની હતી. આ અગાઉના દુર્ઘટનાના છતાં, પાઠ શીખવામાં આવ્યા ન હતા, જેના પરિણામે અત્યાર સુધીની સૌથી ઘાતક દુર્ઘટના બની છે. તાજેતરના ઘટનામાં લગભગ 261 લોકોના મરણની માહિતી છે કારણ કે અનેક કોચ અને એન્જિન પાટા પરથી ઉતરી ગયા. રેલવે મંત્રાલયે દુર્ઘટનાની તપાસના આદેશ આપ્યા છે, જ્યારે ઓડિશાના મુખ્યમંત્રીએ એક દિવસના રાજ્ય શોકની જાહેરાત કરી છે. રેલવેએ પીડિતોના પરિવારો માટે નાણાકીય વળતરની જાહેરાત કરી છે, અને વડાપ્રધાન નરેન્દ્ર મોદીએ પોતાની પીડા વ્યક્ત કરી અને વધારાની રાહતની જાહેરાત કરી."
gujarati_test_44,"The Narendra Modi government has ambitious plans for the Primary Agricultural Credit Societies ranging from computerisation, modernisation of scope, generating employment, and taking the numbers up from about 63,000 that are functional currently to 3,00,000. Sources say though the time frame for sweeping changes for a revamped and robust PACS across the country is by around 2025, the government plans to complete them over the next two years, adding that &amp;#8220;though it looks ambitious, it is doable&amp;#8221;.On June 29, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the computerisation of PACS. Addressing the media, Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur said that the move will benefit 13 crore farmers, mainly small and marginal ones. The PACS play a crucial role in the rural economy and have approximately 13 crore farmers as members.The objective, the government said in a statement, is &amp;#8220;increasing efficiency of PACS, bringing transparency and accountability in their operations, facilitating PACS to diversify their business and undertake multiple activities/services&amp;#8221;. With a total budget outlay of Rs 2516 crore, the project aims to computerise about 63,000 functional PACS with GoI bearing Rs 1528 crore.The government has also proposed that PACS and the District Central Cooperative Banks ( DCCBs), as well as the State Cooperative Banks ( StCBs), will be on a common platform and have a common accounting system as currently there is no uniformity in the software adopted by each. Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation Amit Shah has said that the software will be made available in local languages.Government sources said that PACS will be made &amp;#8220;viable&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;multidimensional&amp;#8221; and will have &amp;#8220;new bylaws&amp;#8221;, indicating that new model bylaws could be published in a month&amp;#8217;s time. Highlighting the humongous scale of the Centre&amp;#8217;s plans for the cooperative sector, a top source in the government said, &amp;#8220;This is not a project of just Rs 2500 crore. Rs 3.19 lakh crore will be spent by GoI, state governments, and NABARD, of which GoI will bear 75%.&amp;#8221; The plan is to have 3 lakh functional and viable PACS in 3 lakh villages across India. The scope of PACS is set to be broadened with more than 20 new options including that of functioning as FPOs.The Ministry of Cooperation has already slashed the surcharge from 12% to 7% for those cooperative societies with earnings between Rs 1 crore and Rs 10 crore. Similarly, the minimum alternate tax ( MAT) has also been slashed from 18.5% to 15% for cooperative societies to provide them a level playing field with corporates.Already, on June 1, the union cabinet decided to allow cooperatives to register as &amp;#8220;buyers&amp;#8221; on the government&amp;#8217;s e-marketing platforms, thus enabling cooperatives to procure goods and services from about 40 lakh vendors across the country who are registered on the GeM portal. Furthermore, on June 8, the RBI raised the limit for individual housing loans for cooperatives banks. While for urban cooperative banks for tier 1, the limit has been raised from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 60 lakh, for tier 2, it has been raised from Rs 70 lakh to Rs 1.40 crore. For the rural cooperative banks, the limit for individual housing loans has been raised from Rs 20 lakh and Rs 30 lakh to Rs 50 lakh and Rs 75 lakh, which is more than double.Secondly, the rural cooperative banks have also been allowed to lend to the commercial real estate residential housing sector and, thirdly, urban cooperative banks have been allowed to provide doorstep banking facilities to their customers, just like commercial banks.'We have made panchayats our focus, and we will work with the state governments,' a top source within the government said, indicating that dialogue with the states has already begun. The government is aware of the challenges of financial misappropriation that have plagued the cooperative sector and believes that the much-needed transparency, which has been added, will stem the same. Newly created PACS will help in employment generation also, officials say.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News , watch Top Videos and Live TV here.","પ્રધાનમંત્રી નરેન્દ્ર મોદીની આગેવાની હેઠળ ભારતીય સરકારે સમગ્ર દેશમાં પ્રાથમિક કૃષિ સાખ સમિતિઓ (PACS)નું પુનર્ગઠન અને આધુનિકીકરણ કરવા માટે મહત્ત્વાકાંક્ષી યોજનાઓનું અનાવરણ કર્યું છે. સરકારનું લક્ષ્ય કાર્યરત PACSની સંખ્યા 63,000થી વધારીને 300,000 કરવા અને તેમના સંચાલનને કમ્પ્યુટરીકૃત કરવાનો છે. આ પગલાથી 13 કરોડ (130 મિલિયન) ખેડૂતો, ખાસ કરીને નાના અને સિમિત ખેડૂતોને લાભ થવાની અપેક્ષા છે. સરકાર આગામી બે વર્ષમાં આ ફેરફારો પૂર્ણ કરવાની યોજના ધરાવે છે, જેમાં રૂ. 2516 કરોડના બજેટની ફાળવણી કરવામાં આવી છે. ઉદ્દેશ્ય PACSના સંચાલનમાં કાર્યક્ષમતા, પારદર્શિતા અને જવાબદારીમાં સુધારો કરવાનો છે, તેમજ તેમના વ્યવસાયમાં વૈવિધ્ય લાવવું અને રોજગાર સૃજન કરવું છે."

gujarati_test_46,"Phase-out of coal-fired power is important, not just for climate, but for the health of millions of people who suffer from its far-reaching consequences. However, as the world steps up climate action, it has underestimated the need to cut down on oil and gas by proposing rapid coal phase-out that may not be socio-politically feasible for countries dependent on it, says a new study.According to the research published in the peer-reviewed science journal Nature Climate Change, the IPCC 1.5℃ pathways have played down the responsibility of rich nations in reducing CO2 emissions, by laying more emphasis on coal, than oil and gas &amp;#8212; all of which are responsible for world's largest source-based emissions.While phasing-out coal is urgent, experts say, the climate models have relied so much on it that it has raised socio-political feasibility concerns in coal-dependent countries like India. The study has once again brought to the fore, the debate over developing countries being made to contribute more to climate mitigation than the developed nations.Fastest Energy Transition; How Feasible?The team modelled the pathways aligning with the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C. It sees, global coal power down by 88% from 2020 to 2030, while global gas power falls 14% during the same decade, and overall oil use 10% in the median pathway.Now, researchers have compared this shift with the fastest power transitions in all countries in the last 50 years, and found that this would require coal-dependent economies like India to wind down coal two times faster than the fastest power sector transition of the last five decades by any country relative to the size of the industry.The study further argues that this pace of global phase-out of coal as proposed in techno-economic optimisation models may be 'at the limits of societal-feasibility' in coal-dependent countries. India, for instance, fulfils 55% of its energy needs through coal, which is critical to meeting its burgeoning energy demands as it provides livelihoods to millions through direct and indirect jobs.Now, let's say, the decline in coal is not as rapid as suggested, then perhaps the other countries will need to mitigate faster to keep warming below 1.5℃, the team demonstrated through models. 'If realistic limits are put on the pace of coal phase-out in developing countries, that would mean wealthy nations will have to cut emissions 50% faster than in current 1.5℃ pathways for a fairer and feasible energy transition,' writes co-author James Price from University College London.India's Coal ConundrumCoal is the most important and abundant fossil fuel in India and accounts for 55% of the country&amp;#8217;s energy needs. With substantial reserves, the government has maintained that coal is going to stay as a major source of energy in the foreseeable future. Just to give an idea, the commercial primary energy consumption in India has grown by 700% in the last four decades.Despite vigorous push for renewables, the country will require a base load capacity of coal-based generation for stability and also for energy security.Whole India has committed to meeting 50% of its energy needs from non-fossil fuels by 2030, it has maintained the pace of transition to clean energy will be viewed in the light of national circumstances, and principle of common but differentiated responsibilities the transfer of climate finance and low-cost climate technologies.As lead author Greg Muttitt from Geneva-based International Institute for International Development (IISD) says, ending coal use is urgent, for both climate and health, but it takes time to enable a just transition in countries that are highly coal dependent. Limiting warming to 1.5℃ requires cuts in all three fossil fuels, coal, oil and gas. Perhaps, rebalancing mitigation measures may show more feasible paths to achieving the Paris Agreement goals.Read all the Latest India News here","એક નવા અભ્યાસ સૂચવે છે કે જ્યારે કોલસાથી ચાલતી વીજળીનું ઉત્પાદન બંધ કરવું પર્યાવરણ અને જાહેર આરોગ્ય માટે મહત્વપૂર્ણ છે, ત્યારે જલવાયુ ક્રિયા યોજનાઓમાં કોલસા પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કરવાથી તેલ અને ગેસમાં ઘટાડો કરવાની આવશ્યકતાની ખ્યાલ ઓછી થઈ ગઈ છે. આ અભ્યાસ, જે નેચર ક્લાઈમેટ ચેન્જમાં પ્રકાશિત થયો છે, દલીલ કરે છે કે ભારત જેવા કોલસા પર આધારિત દેશો માટે વર્તમાન જલવાયુ મોડલ દ્વારા પ્રસ્તાવિત ઝડપી ફેઝ-આઉટ હાંસલ કરવું મુશ્કેલ હોઈ શકે છે. સંશોધન તે ચર્ચાને પ્રકાશિત કરે છે કે શું વિકસિત દેશો પર્યાવરણ નિયંત્રણ પ્રયત્નોમાં અસમાન ભાર વહન કરવો જોઈએ. અભ્યાસના નિષ્કર્ષ મુજબ, ન્યાયસંગત અને શક્ય ઊર્જા પરિવર્તન માટે સમૃદ્ધ દેશોએ વર્તમાન માર્ગોની તુલનામાં 50% ઝડપી ઉત્સર્જન કાપવું પડશે."

Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal, MK Stalin among others will be arriving in Patna from Wednesday night. Kumar, who is the host, is keeping a close watch on the arrangements.Colourful posters and banners, including those of Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal, Punjab CM Bhagwat Mann, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and others can be seen in the state capital. Leaders will be staying at the VIP guest house and prime hotels in the city.The BJP, meanwhile, is also trying to garner support and forming new allies. On Tuesday (June 20), Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) patron and former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi met union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi. His son Santosh Suman, who was a cabinet minister in the 'Mahagathbandhan' government, was also present.The meeting was important as Manjhi has a strong Dalit vote bank in Bihar. Soon after the meeting, the HAM officially announced that it was an NDA ally now.Here is all you need to know about the upcoming opposition meeting:Bihar CM Nitish Kumar will propose to form a core committee at the meeting of opposition leadersThe committee should resolve the issue on seat sharing and all parties should accept the decisionThere should be a common opposition candidate against the BJP and it would be better if that is decided firstKumar can also seek proposals from all parties regarding seat sharingWho all will be attending?Congress national president Mallikarjun Kharge, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and People&amp;#8217;s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti, Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann and Left leaders will be attending the meeting.What is likely to be discussed?A close confidant of Nitish Kumar said the CM, who is trying to bring the opposition parties together, will be hosting the leaders. As soon as the meeting starts, he will make an opening speech and, during the meeting, he will urge everyone to present their opinions on drawing up a strategy on how to fight the BJP as one for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Kumar will likely be named convener of the united opposition front and will then launch his formal campaign against the BJP. In his speech, he will address the need to form a core committee with representatives of all parties.The CM's advice will be to form the core committee, a powerful body to resolve issues within the alliance if any arise. The decisions of this committee should be considered as final and, in case of a dispute, its decision will be binding. He will also talk about fixing the name of the coordinator for the core committee.Kumar will also be urging the opposition parties to agree to defeat the BJP that the opposition should have a common candidate against the saffron camp. In doing so, he will request all parties to show generosity. Mamata has also given the same advice that defeating the BJP was not a difficult task if there was a united front.If there is an issue with seat sharing, the core committee should solve it. The Bihar CM will urge everyone in his keynote address to suggest a formula for seat sharing. If there is any problem with seat sharing, then the core committee should resolve it. Its decision should be final and binding, as it can then prevent conflicts.'We have decided on three things. The date, venue and that the heads of the opposition parties will attend the meeting. We will decide the date and venue of the next meeting on June 23. Beyond this, if anyone wants to jump the gun, it will not be advisable,' said the TMC's Rajya Sabha MP Derek O&amp;#8217;Brien.Decoding caste dynamics in BiharKumar has been criticised for switching sides and abandoning those close to him.

Former union minister RCP Singh (from the Kurmi caste), who was once Kumar's main man, joined the BJP. Upendra Kushwaha (from the Koeri community), who was once closest to the CM, had resigned from the JD(U) and formed his own party, the Rashtriya Lok Janata Dal (RLJD).Manjhi (Mahadalit community), who was an ally of the JD(U) till three days ago, has declared his support for the NDA. Samrat Choudhary, the present state BJP president, is also from the Koeri caste.According to Census data, other backward classes (OBC) form 50 percent of the population in the state. Of this, 11 percent are Kurmis and Koeris, while 15 percent are Yadavs. The Muslim population is 17 percent followed by dalits at 16 percent and so-called upper castes at 15 percent.","આગામી પટણાની વિપક્ષી મીટિંગમાં રાહુલ ગાંધી અને 18 રાજકીય પક્ષોના નેતાઓ ભેગા થઈને ભાજપ વિરુદ્ધ રણનીતિ બનાવશે. ઘટના ની ભવ્યતા હોવા છતાં, ગાંધીની ઉપસ્થિતિ, જેમના નેતૃત્વને સતત ચૂંટણી હારથી ચિન્હિત કરવામાં આવ્યું છે, વિપક્ષની યોજનાની અસરકારકતા પર શંકા ઊભી કરે છે. મકાન માલિક નીતિશ કુમાર એક નિર્ણાયક કોર કમિટીની દરખાસ્ત કરવાના છે, પરંતુ ગાંધીના ટ્રેક રેકોર્ડ સાથે, બેઠકોના વહેંચણી જેવા મુદ્દાઓનું સમાધાન મુશ્કેલ સાબિત થઈ શકે છે. ગાંધી એક મુખ્ય ખેલાડી હોવા સાથે, વિપક્ષની એકતા સંદિગ્ધ છે."

gujarati_test_50,"The Kashmir Valley is experiencing a long-awaited sense of justice and relief as the truth about backdoor appointments with terror links that had plagued the region for decades comes to light. In an unprecedented move, the Jammu and Kashmir administration in the last couple of months has taken strong action against individuals involved in anti-national activities and connections to terrorist elements, resulting in their immediate termination from jobs.Last week, three government employees, including the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the University of Kashmir, were shown the doors as part of this cleansing process. The university, once considered a hub of anti-India activities, has been undergoing a transformative change. Before the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, the then governor, who is also the university&amp;#8217;s chancellor, faced difficulties in holding events at the main Gandhi Bhawan auditorium due to anti-India and pro-Pakistan slogans raised outside the premises, but now the same university hoists Tricolour on all major buildings with pride.According to the government dossier, the PRO, Faheem Aslam, was actively involved in anti-national activities and had close links with separatist groups and other anti-India forces. He was using his position at the university to propagate an anti-India narrative. Faheem Aslam is a hardcore member of Pak Embedded High Value Asset (PEHVA) of terror outfits, responsible for promoting and glamorising terrorism through his write-ups that would be published in leading local daily of J&amp;#038;K.Additionally, two other employees, one policeman, and a revenue official, were also sacked for their involvement in similar activities.The decision to remove these individuals from their positions has been met with approval by the students of Kashmir university. They see it as a sign of Lt. Governor Manoj Sinha&amp;#8217;s determination to root out terrorism from the region. 'The day he took over, he had said he would ensure the entire ecosystem of terrorism is eradicated, and he is working towards that direction. The youth like me welcome such decisions,&amp;#8221; said one student.This is not the first time the L-G administration has taken decisive action against those with questionable intentions. Earlier, two doctors were also terminated for forging post-mortem reports on behalf of Pakistan, attempting to distort the truth surrounding the tragic deaths of Asiya and Neelofar, who drowned.More than 50 such individuals have been removed from their government positions as part of this ongoing process, with legal proceedings initiated against some of them.For decades, deserving candidates in Kashmir had their aspirations crushed by a corrupt system that favoured individuals with terror links and political influence. While the common Kashmiri&amp;#8217;s children faced limited opportunities, some separatist leaders ensured privileged positions and quality education for their own children, often resorting to undue influence.However, the tide has turned, and a new era of accountability and transparency has dawned upon the Valley. Over 50 individuals who were either connected to terrorism or employed without following proper norms have been identified and terminated from their positions. This momentous decision marks a significant step towards restoring justice and equality for the people of Kashmir.During the investigation, shocking revelations emerged, exposing the depths of the corrupt practices that had long plagued the region. Some individuals were found to have been given government jobs based on nothing more than a small piece of paper (chits) issued by high-ranking ministers, without any proper appointment orders. This blatant abuse of power had denied genuine candidates their rightful opportunities for growth and development.A government official, who requested to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, commented, 'We delved into the depths of the system, and what we found was truly disheartening. The very individuals who claimed to fight against discrimination were the ones responsible for perpetuating it, ensuring their own prosperity while depriving the common Kashmiri of their basic rights.'The purging of these corrupt elements has not only reinstated a sense of justice but also fostered renewed hope among the youth of Kashmir. With the removal of individuals linked to terrorism, the government is sending a strong message that there is no place for such elements in the region's administration. This resolute stand is bolstering the spirits of the deserving candidates who were once oppressed and discriminated against, paving the way for a brighter and more inclusive future.As the sun sets over the picturesque landscapes of Kashmir, the Valley now stands witness to the beginning of a new chapter. People rejoice in the fact that justice is finally being served, and the seeds of a transparent and equitable system have been sown. With each corrupt link severed, the shackles that once bound the dreams of the common Kashmiri are slowly being broken, and the echoes of change reverberate through the mountains, carrying the promise of a better tomorrow.'This is what has changed in Kashmir after article 370 was removed' a local resident commented.","કાશ્મીર ખીણ ન્યાય અને રાહતનો અનુભવ કરી રહી છે કારણ કે સરકાર રાષ્ટ્રવિરોધી પ્રવૃત્તિઓ અને આતંકવાદી કડીઓમાં સામેલ વ્યક્તિઓ સામે કાર્યવાહી કરી રહી છે. છેલ્લા કેટલાક મહિનાઓમાં, ત્રીણ સરકારી કર્મચારીઓ, જેમાં એક યુનિવર્સિટી પીઆરઓનો સમાવેશ થાય છે,ને અલગાવવાદી જૂથો અને ભારત વિરોધી શક્તિઓ સાથેના સંબંધો માટે બરતરફ કરવામાં આવ્યા હતા. આ સફાઈ પ્રક્રિયાને કાશ્મીરી વિદ્યાર્થીઓ દ્વારા મંજૂરી મળી છે જે તેને આતંકવાદને નાબૂદ કરવાની દિશામાં એક પગલું તરીકે જુએ છે. 50 થી વધુ વ્યક્તિઓને તેમના પદ પરથી દૂર કરવામાં આવ્યા છે, જેના દ્વારા ભ્રષ્ટ આચરણોને ઉજાગર કરવામાં આવ્યા છે જેના કારણે લાયક ઉમેદવારોને તકોથી વંચિત કરવામાં આવ્યા હતા. આ શુદ્ધિ ન્યાયને પુનઃસ્થાપિત કરે છે અને કાશ્મીરમાં એક ઉજ્જવળ અને વધુ સમાવિષ્ટ ભવિષ્ય માટે આશા પણ જગાવે છે."

gujarati_test_52,"New Delhi: The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&amp;amp;CC) has directed all state wildlife departments to take serious note of avian flu cases and report mortality of wildlife to the ministry on priority. Bird deaths have been reported from Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.In Himachal Pradesh, the state forest department confirmed the death of 2,300 migratory birds, largely comprising bar-headed goose along with river tern, brown-headed gull, and cormorants in and around the Pong Dam Sanctuary area. Poultry birds have been affected in Haryana, crows in Rajasthan and ducks in Kerala.Senior forest department officers from Himachal Pradesh said bird deaths were first noticed on December 28 when field staff were estimating the numbers of migratory birds. The field staff began combing the entire sanctuary area and found more dead birds. 'We do a fortnightly estimation of bird arrivals during this season. We had estimated the arrival of 57,000 migratory birds by December 15. The birds found dead are being buried as per protocol and we are isolating the few that survived,' said Upasana Patial, Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), North.Samples collected from the dead birds in Himachal Pradesh were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal. NIHSAD informed the Department of Animal Husbandry on Tuesday that the preliminary results of all five samples tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus following a Real-time - Polymerase chain reaction test.The wildlife division of the union environment ministry told states in its letter that they should take all possible measures and precautions to prevent transmission of diseases, if any, in other animals and human beings. 'Surveillance for mortality of wildlife particularly needs to be taken up on priority and states are requested to report such incidences of mortality to this ministry,' the environment ministry said.The ministry highlighted that a large number of migratory birds visit India during this season and thus states are advised to keep a strict vigil on wintering habitats of such birds, including wetlands, for signs of mortality or disease outbreak. 'We have alerted chief wildlife wardens and principal chief conservators of forests in the states as well as other senior officials in state administrations and requested them to bring to notice any large scale bird deaths,' said a senior official from the environment ministry.Bar-headed goose are the highest flying migratory birds and fly to India to escape the harsh winter in Central Asia and Russia. Migratory birds use flyways or specific migratory routes during their annual migration cycle. The Central Asian Flyway is one such, and one of the most crucial in the world. The Indian sub-continent hosts a major portion of the CAF and India is the winter home for 90% of bird species known to use this migratory route. According to government data, around 370 species of migratory birds from three flyways visit the Indian sub-continent.The ministry also shared a slew of guidelines to be followed while handling birds. State wildlife departments have been specifically asked to step up surveillance of migratory birds and have been advised to prepare an action plan for monitoring, surveillance and any emergency. 'Surveillance should not be restricted to the protected areas alone, but to all such wetlands and habitats that provide staging grounds to migrating birds and to areas where there is a possibility of interaction between poultry and migratory birds,' the ministry has said.A weekly report, too, has been sought from states on sighting of migratory birds within and outside protected areas, approximate number and species of birds that have arrived and any other information deemed necessary.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here","ભારતમાં પર્યાવરણ, વન અને હવામાન પરિવર્તન મંત્રાલયે રાજ્ય વન્યજીવન વિભાગોને એવિયન ફ્લૂના કેસોના કારણે વન્યજીવનના મૃત્યુની રિપોર્ટ કરવાની સૂચના આપી છે. હિમાચલ પ્રદેશ, હરિયાણા, રાજસ્થાન, મધ્ય પ્રદેશ અને કેરળમાં પક્ષીઓના મૃત્યુની જાણકારી મળી છે. માત્ર હિમાચલ પ્રદેશમાં 2,300 પ્રવાસી પક્ષીઓના મૃત્યુ થયા છે, જેમાં બાર-હેડેડ ગીઝ, નદીના ટર્ન, બ્રાઉન-હેડેડ ગલ અને કોર્મોરન્ટ્સનો સમાવેશ થાય છે. મૃત પક્ષીઓના નમૂનાઓનો પરીક્ષણ H5N1 એવિયન ઇન્ફ્લૂએન્જા વાયરસ માટે સકારાત્મક મળ્યો છે. મંત્રાલયે રાજ્યોને પ્રવાસી પક્ષીઓના વસવાટની મોનીટરીંગમાં સાવચેત રહેવા અને રોગના પ્રસારને અટકાવવા માટે તકેદારીના પગલાં લેવા અનુરોધ કર્યો છે. પ્રવાસી પક્ષીઓની દેખાવ પર સાપ્તાહિક રિપોર્ટ પણ માગવામાં આવી છે."
gujarati_test_53,"The COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly the worst global health disaster of the twenty-first century. It has ravaged economies, destroyed livelihoods, devastated families and curtailed civil liberties in many parts of the world. But not all countries have been affected equally. Rich countries, such as the US and those in Europe, suffered a higher number of cases (see Figure 1) and casualties (see Figure 2), necessitating a larger response from the developed world in the search for a vaccine.This is not the first global pandemic to destroy lives and nations. For instance, the Spanish flu in the early twentieth century, when medical science was not as advanced as in recent times, was far more lethal. Importantly, the Spanish flu struck during the First World War when press freedom was severely curtailed in most parts of the world, but in Spain, which was neutral during the war, the press could freely report on cases and fatalities, ultimately giving the pandemic its name. COVID-19 has not been subjected to such restrictions and therefore captured the attention of political leaders worldwide from the early stages of the outbreak. Governments responded by locking down countries and imposing other restrictions, but the only permanent solution to the pandemic was the discovery of a vaccine.Typically, vaccines can take years to be developed and go through clinical trials before being released for public use. But the COVID-19 vaccine was developed and released in less than a year since the outbreak was declared a pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued an emergency use listing (ELU) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 31 December 2020 and granted ELUs to two versions of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and SKBio on 15 February 2021. Currently, 82 vaccine candidates are under clinical development and 182 vaccine candidates are in the pre-clinical development phase, a remarkable achievement in global public health.Race for VaccinesWith the discovery of the vaccine, COVID-19 has ceased to be a global humanitarian issue and has metamorphosed into a traditional political economy problem of inequality in access between the rich and the poor countries. In several countries, this has also emerged as a problem of unequal access across regions and demographics. Globally, the number of vaccine doses administered per 100 people is 6.5 (as of 25 March 2021), but there are significant variations across countries and continents. Israel has achieved 115 doses per 100 people, while the US has administered over 35 doses per 100 people and the European Union has achieved 15 doses per 100 people. Meanwhile Asian countries have achieved a modest 4.5 doses per 100 people, mostly on the back of India and China's significant manufacturing capacities. For most African countries, however, there is either no data available or they have yet to achieve even a single dose per 100 people (see Figure 3).The rich countries have used their economic and political muscle to corner as many vaccine doses as possible, while most poor nations rely on the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access—or COVAX—initiative by UNICEF, GAVI (vaccine alliance) and WHO to promote equitable access to the vaccines. Despite efforts at improving access, GAVI has declared that merely 27 percent of the vulnerable population in developing countries will benefit from COVAX vaccines this year. The distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines has once again exposed the reality of the world's poor, who are routinely deprived of basic human rights, in general, and justice, in particular. There are now increasing concerns of 'vaccine apartheid'—a stark inequality in global access to vaccines. While rich nations have rolled out massive vaccination drives following the availability and emergency authorisation of multiple vaccines, poorer nations see no hope of gaining access in the near future.This is despite repeated efforts since the onset of the pandemic to declare the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good, including an appeal from 115 international personalities and 19 Nobel laureates to adopt legal measures to ensure it is made available free of charge to all. Experts have also made several suggestions on how to operationalise such a global drive, such as a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights by the World Trade Organization and governments to encourage emergency production to meet the global demand for vaccines. Despite repeated pleas calling for solidarity and global cooperation, rich countries have yet to adopt such measures.Several observers have made comparisons between the emerging situation and the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1990s. The WHO has declared that while the production of COVID-19 vaccine doses has exceeded the number of global infections, equitable access is still far from reach as over 75 percent of these doses are concentrated in the rich nations, which comprise 60 percent of global GDP. The WHO has also warned against 'vaccine nationalism', adding that at the current rate, most poor nations will not have access to vaccines for at least another year while rich nations will likely complete universal vaccination in 2021. This will mean delayed global immunity. Areas of affluence will achieve COVID-19 immunity while most of the world population will continue to struggle with a resurgence in infection, economic slowdown and the perpetuation of existing global inequity.Vaccine Nationalism: Threat to Global CooperationThe main threat to global cooperation on vaccination is the growing vaccine nationalism across major manufacturing nations. Vaccine nationalism typically occurs when governments sign agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers to pre-order vaccines, blocking the availability to other countries in the process. Other ways of practicing vaccine nationalism include when governments enter tacit or explicit agreements with local manufacturers to promote and protect global market shares for their vaccines. For instance, China recently announced a new visa policy for travellers, contingent on them taking the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine. This is likely to have widespread repercussions since the WHO is yet to approve any of the Chinese vaccines.Wealthy countries reportedly ordered over two million doses of the vaccine even as they were in trials, with several nations pre-ordering multiple doses per citizen. Governments now have more information (on efficacy and side effects) on each vaccine than they did when pre-ordering doses, and can establish clearer vaccination strategies for their populations. Under such circumstances, the massive stockpiling of vaccines—with no clear intention of using them—is myopic, selfish and suboptimal from the global perspective. The US, for instance, is holding several million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine but has not authorised its usage yet. Several other countries that have authorised its usage, such as Mexico, have requested this stockpile be released. Although the US announced it will ship four million doses of the vaccine to Canada and Mexico, it continues to hold large reserves without Food and Drug Administration approval for emergency usage. The US's reluctance to share vaccines is also pushing several Latin American countries to enter deals with Russia and China.The WHO has expressed concern over vaccine nationalism and rich countries cornering massive resources at the expense of global access. Even pharmaceutical firms appear concerned by vaccine nationalism. SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla has said that vaccine nationalism could derail WHO efforts to deliver two billion doses to poor and middle-income countries. Wealthy countries will likely achieve immunity due to the timely access to the vaccines, but the threat from new variants and mutations will remain if most countries remain under-vaccinated.The WHO has repeatedly warned that restrictions to getting the vaccines out widely will impact the collective ability to control COVID-19 and prevent variants from emerging. Although many pharmaceutical companies have said their vaccines are mostly effective against new variants with some 'tweaks', the experience of the past year has shown that even small 'tweaks' take time and can threaten new and rapid contagions.Countries are restricting supply of materials needed to make more vaccines which is leading to long delays and missed timelines across global manufacturers. For instance, the Biden administration invoked the Defence Production Act to block export of raw materials, and SII has already announced that the move will lead to delays in the production of Novavax vaccines for global supply.Vaccines are also emerging as a means to expand global influence. Russia and China got an early foothold in Eastern Europe and Latin America with their indigenously developed vaccines. These vaccines do not have authorisation from the WHO yet, however, both countries have engaged in extensive media campaigns and have emerged as major suppliers to countries across Latin America, Africa and the Middle East. Given how quickly vaccines were developed and trials conducted (in less transparent ways in some instances19), some countries have begun to revise vaccine efficacy results after conducting their own local trials. For instance, Brazil and Turkey have lowered the efficacy of China's Sinovac vaccine. Trials in Turkey showed 83 percent efficacy and those in Brazil showed 50.4 percent efficacy, significantly lower than the claims of over 90 percent efficacy by Sinovac. At the same time, despite repeated attempts at negotiations, there is heightening tension between the European Union (EU) and UK. This has led to new rows over the supply of vaccines produced within the EU, and the EU could soon announce export bans on the vaccines.There have also been concerns regarding price discrimination practices followed by manufacturers across different markets. For instance, South Africa revealed that it acquired 1.5 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca at US$5.25, which is more than twice what the EU paid (US$2.15). But governments that have jointly funded the development of different vaccines have successfully negotiated for lower prices—the Moderna vaccine is cheaper in US than in Europe, while the Pfizer vaccine is cheaper in Europe than in the US. Importantly, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson are the only two vaccine manufacturers to commit to not profit from the pandemic, which is why the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is available at low rates around the world (about US$4) and is the leading candidate in the COVAX initiative.More recently, the optics of vaccine nationalism has hit centre stage with several European countries suspending the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine over concerns of patients developing blood clots. This decision will have far reaching consequences as the vaccination drive has been slow in most European countries and there is mounting domestic pressure. The WHO and drug regulators have cautioned against the hasty suspension of the vaccine citing no evidence that links it to developing blood clots, with the Europe's medicines regulator saying it is 'firmly convinced' of the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. This jostling by pharmaceutical companies, governments and trade blocs is likely to undermine public confidence and cause setbacks to the overall vaccination drive across countries.Indian ExceptionalismAmid evolving global tensions over the vaccines, India has emerged as a key player. It remains the only major COVID-19 vaccine-manufacturing country to actively supply to the global community while scaling up its domestic vaccination drive, leveraging its position as a leading pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing country. According to a submission to the Rajya Sabha by Ashwini Kumar Choubey, the minister of state for health, on 16 March, India had supplied nearly 60 million doses to over 71 countries, including neighbouring nations. By July 2021, India plans to vaccinate 300 million people across the country, and has rapidly scaled its vaccination drive since it began in January (see Figure 4). India has also benefited from local administrative capabilities that have developed through the experience of previous vaccination drives, such as those for polio and smallpox. India is currently mass producing two COVID-19 vaccines—Covaxin, indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and National Institute of Virology; and Covishield, as the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by SII is known locally. Covishield, one of only two vaccines approved for ELU by the WHO, is among the most widely administered COVID-19 vaccines globally.India is not only supplying vaccines to other countries but is also participating in several initiatives to share clinical research and knowhow regarding mass vaccinations; the government is holding a series of training camps for partner countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Bhutan, Myanmar, Oman and Nepal. At the recently concluded Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between India, US, Japan and Australia, the countries pledged to 'expand and accelerate' COVID-19 vaccine production in India and to supply a billion doses of the vaccine across Asia and the Indo-Pacific by 2022. The US International Development Finance Corp will provide financing to Indian manufacturing firm Biological E to produce at least one billion doses of the Novavax and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines, with supporting finance from Japan through concessional yen loans for India.ConclusionAmid escalating vaccine nationalism, is there any hope for global cooperation? The COVID-19 pandemic has mutated into a global political economy crisis, with new fault lines emerging along market shares and intellectual property regimes. Although the scientific knowhow and technology solutions have been developed in time through collaboration between governments and business entities across countries, the new constraints to the equitable access of vaccines arises from trade protectionism and limits to technology sharing due to existing intellectual property regimes. The uncertainty of the virus is being overshadowed by the growing uncertainty from vaccine nationalism. The challenge now is to expand vaccine production capacity and improve market access, which cannot be left to voluntary cooperation alone and must be resolved through global leadership to urgently transcend existing fractures. Global cooperation needs compulsory and explicit action. India has shown the way by becoming a major global vaccine supplier while simultaneously scaling up its domestic vaccination drive. Will wealthier nations follow this example?This paper was first published on ORF.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.

gujarati_test_60,"New Zealand allrounder Michael Bracewell, who was a last-minute replacement for the injured Will Jacks in the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) squad, slammed an unbeaten 105 off just 55 balls in a practice match and has put opposition bowlers on notice. In the process, the Kiwi, who got no takers in the Indian Premier League (IPL) mini-auction in December, showed how mistaken the franchises were to ignore him then.The 32-year-old allrounder knows a thing or two about playing in India. He had cracked an ODI century on the tour of India earlier this year and bagged the most number of wickets in the T20I series. Bracewell adds depth to any side and the fact that he looks in fine fettle will make RCB captain Faf du Plessis assured.IPL 2023 Full Coverage | IPL 2023 Schedule | IPL 2023 Results | IPL Orange Cap | IPL Purple CapBracewell&amp;#8217;s record in T20s has been impressive. He had 2,284 runs in his kitty in 117 T20s, including a century and 13 half-centuries. His runs have come at a strike rate of 133.48. He has also bagged 40 wickets in the shortest format of the game. For the national side, he has played eight Tests, 19 ODIs and 16 T20Is and has hit a couple of ODI tons. He has a four-fer in Tests and his career-best bowling figure in T20Is is a brilliant 3/5 against Ireland, which he recorded in Belfast last year.Michael Bracewell scored 105* (55) with 8 fours and 7 Sixes in RCB&amp;#8217;s practice match. pic.twitter.com/kWZCqMcnx4— Mufaddal Vohra (@mufaddal_vohra) March 31, 2023Bracewell, therefore, would have been a good strategic pick, but surprisingly, even after entering the auction at a relatively modest base price of Rs 1 crore, he was ignored.Also read &amp;#8211; Explained: How Impact Player Rule in IPL 2023 Works, Who Can be Impact Player, How Are Toss Rules Changed and MoreThe importance of Bracewell in the team also stems from the fact that even if he does not feature in the starting eleven, he can be used with good effect as an &amp;#8216;impact player&amp;#8217;. This innovation introduced in the IPL this year will allow teams to change one of the players in the starting eleven to suit their requirements in the middle of the match. However, the change has to be done during the stipulated time frames. This will allow a player like Bracewell to be brought by RCB in place of another overseas player as a specialist batsman or bowler.RCB are slated to play five-time champions Mumbai Indians in their opening game at their home ground M Chinnaswamy Stadium on April 2. This would be their first home match in four years as the IPL has gone back to being organised all across India based on the old home-away format.RCB were unlucky last year and despite winning their first playoff game (first qualifier) against Lucknow Super Giants at Kolkata&amp;#8217;s Eden Gardens, they were edged out by Rajasthan Royals in the second qualifier at Ahmedabad&amp;#8217;s Narendra Modi Stadium.Get the latest Cricket News here","ન્યુઝીલેન્ડના ઓલરાઉન્ડર માઈકલ બ્રેસવેલે આવનારા ઇન્ડિયન પ્રીમિયર લીગ (આઈપીએલ) સીઝન પહેલાં રોયલ ચેલેન્જર્સ બેંગલોર (આરસીબી) માટે એક પ્રેક્ટિસ મેચમાં તેમની પ્રતિભાનું પ્રદર્શન કર્યું. બ્રેસવેલે માત્ર 55 બોલમાં નોટઆઉટ 105 રન બનાવ્યા, જેણે તેમને ઈજાગ્રસ્ત વિલ જેક્સ માટે અંતિમ સમયમાં વિકલ્પ તરીકે તેમની મૂલ્ય સાબિત કરી. આઈપીએલ મીની-ઓક્શનમાં અવગણવામાં આવ્યા હોવા છતાં, બ્રેસવેલનો ટી20માં પ્રભાવશાળી રેકોર્ડ, જેમાં એક સદી અને 13 અડધી સદીનો સમાવેશ થાય છે, અને બેટ અને બોલ બંને સાથે યોગદાન આપવાની તેમની ક્ષમતા, તેમને આરસીબી માટે મૂલ્યવાન સંપત્તિ બનાવે છે. તેમના પ્રદર્શનએ આઈપીએલ 2023 પહેલાં વિરોધી બોલરોને સતર્ક કરી દીધા છે."
gujarati_test_61,"The economic growth of India is often compared with its blow hot-blow cold neighbour China. In 1960, the GDP of the Indian economy at $148 billion was way ahead of Chinese GDP at $128 billion. Instructively, India stayed ahead of China till 1977, and it was only in 1978, the year China opened to the world, that its GDP at $296.6 billion inched ahead of Indian GDP at $296.3 billion. But China-India or 'Chindia' comparison ended there. The next four decades have belonged to China. It catapulted from subsistence-level agriculture economy to manufacturing- and export-led behemoth. Its metamorphosis from $296.6 billion GDP in 1978 to $8 trillion in 2012 before galloping to $18 trillion in 2021, growing consistently around 9.5 percent per annum, has no parallel. In last nine years, China has added $10 trillion to the Chinese economy.And what an amazing success story of distributive, equitable and inclusive growth it has been. In four decades, China has done the heavy lifting of taking 850 million people out of poverty. In 1981, 90 per cent of its population was below the international poverty threshold, the latest World Bank data puts it at 1 per cent. The Chinese success story is led by three things: manufacture, export, and infrastructure. Its massive infrastructure push apart from becoming enabler of the growth has also been a growth propeller in its own right.The dragon has shown the path. And, it is the time for India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to show that 'the elephant too can dance'. Budget 2022, therefore, has a lot of expectations riding on it.Prime Minister Narendra Modi thinks audaciously big. As he prepares the nation for Vision @2047, he should think bigger - catapulting the economy from $3 trillion to $5 trillion by 2025, $10 trillion by 2035 and $25 trillion by 2047 when India celebrates 100 years of independence.To actualise the dream, the country must consistently achieve double-digit growth, a feat not achieved in past; manufacturing sector must gallop from its measly 17 per cent contribution to GDP with a low 11 per cent employment contribution; exports must grow exponentially; agriculture must transform itself.To make this happen, India needs a quantum leap in physical, social and digital infrastructure. The Finance Minister must start with removing the bottlenecks and implementation bugs in some of the flagship projects of the government.Smart City MissionThe Smart Cities Mission, launched in 2015 with an investment of Rs 2,05,018 crore, aims to transform 100 selected cities by driving growth, making them bankable and more liveable, improving mobility, ushering in best practices like solid waste management, bringing in smart e-governance solutions and unleashing the power of technology.It is a timely mission to correct the urban grid lock and mess that exists in cities and towns stuck in the muddle due to haphazard and unplanned evolution. The mission ticks all the right boxes - special purpose vehicle-led institutional structure, area-based and city-based development, PPP approach, retrofitting, redevelopment and greenfield projects. These are citizen-centric solutions but as hundreds of more cities wait in the wings for their chance, urgent corrective measures are needed for the Mission to deliver. And, these steps have to be taken in terms of timeliness, financing, institutional robustness, project selection, implementation hurdles and project impact.Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and AMRUTThe Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) have been two transformative programmes. While the key priority area of AMRUT (1.0) was water supply followed by sewerage, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (1.0) focused on eliminating open defecation and promoting solid waste management. They also aimed at biggest behavioural change initiatives attempted anywhere in the world. The achievements of these two programmes are notable. Nonetheless, the country today is nowhere close to the actualisation of the century old sanitation dream of Mahatma Gandhi.In 2021, the government launched a more ambitious Swachh (2.0) and AMRUT (2.0). While former focuses on the goal to 'make the cities completely free of garbage', the later aims at 'improving sewage and septic management, making our cities water-safe cities and ensuring that no sewage drains anywhere in our rivers'. Actual performance of Swachh and AMRUT are appreciable, but teething troubles remain on ground to make the gains sustainable. Finance Minister must share a clear strategy to make the gains achieved so far sustainable and provide adequate outlay for both the Missions.Pradhan Mantri Awas YojanaThe Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, both urban and gramin, are working for the target population. The house help at my in-laws' place received a sanctioned amount under the scheme to convert her kuccha dwelling into a pucca house in her village. But the ambitious goal of 'housing for all by 2022' looks unattainable.  Budget 2022 must make mid-course correction and provide adequate outlay, implementation strategy and monitoring framework to complete the two flagship programmes by 2024.Rural ElectrificationThe rural electrification programme was not launched by the Narendra Modi government, but full credit to it for fast-tracking 100 per cent electrification in all villages. But access to 24X7 quality supply of power has eluded not just villages but even towns and cities. The biggest drain to the sector remains poorly performing and terminally debt-laden distribution sector. It is time for a strategic rethink to herald next-generation reforms, giving primacy to the hard-core reality that one size does not fit all.Health InfrastructureOur health infrastructure - at primary, secondary and tertiary level - was in tatters well before the onslaught of COVID-19. Worse, of the total health expenditure equivalent to 5 per cent of the GDP, the contribution of the government is barely 1 per cent with out-of-pocket expenditure of families making up 4 per cent. Inequity is inbuilt in the system where poorest suffer the most. And, COVID-19 delivered a body blow to this creaking system. What the country needs and what the Finance Minister must provide is a quantum jump in government spending in the health sector, both preventive and curative.EducationSeveral aspects of the Indian education system are in deep trouble, but the author wants to focus on school education for children between 3 and 18 years of age. Under the Right to Education Act, free and compulsory education to children between 6 and 14 years of age is a fundamental right, to be ensured by the government. In the last decade, thanks to RTE, there were impressive gains in school enrolment - and schemes like mid-day meal, free cycle to girl students helped with the retention rate.Sadly, in the last two years since COVID hit us, school closure and remote learning have widened the learning gap, with urban and rural poor being the worst hit. The increase in 'learning poverty' has been monumental and the Finance Minister must provide solutions, including a massive outlay for new tools of learning (smartphone, laptop and internet connectivity), for the poor children lest the learning poverty becomes permanent.Digital InfrastructureIndia has taken giant strides in creation of digital infrastructure, so much so that the present generation will not believe that it was barely 27 years ago that VSNL had started its internet service. Today, India has more internet connections than any other country except China. Digital technology has transformed the way we work, where we work. It is changing not only the governance model, but 2022 Assembly elections are proof that technology is even changing electioneering.But India continues to have a sharp digital divide. Half of India's population lacks internet access, many more have to do with poor service, with one study claiming that more than 50000 villages are without mobile connectivity. The smartphone penetration in India is substantially lower when compared to the US, China or even Indonesia. India needs to string the whole nation together, including the villages, with high-speed broadband and 100 per cent mobile connectivity through affordable smartphones. The Finance Minister must provide the pathway for the same. The gains for incremental investment are stratospheric and the cost of not investing now is too high. It is time to make a choice.This is the second article in a two-part series on how Budget 2022 can deliver on infrastructure and growth.

gujarati_test_62,"The number of Demat accounts in India reached a staggering 100.5 million in August 2022, breaching the 100 million mark, as per data from prominent depositories NSDL and CDSL. The number, which stood at a mere 40.9 million before the Covid pandemic struck in 2020, accelerated to this historic mark, thanks to the largely growing account-opening pace in 2022.While February saw the highest opening figures this year, 2.9 million new accounts, it was followed by 2.7 million in May, 2.4 million in April, and 2.2 million last month. Reflective of investor confidence in the market, increased Demat account openings work in lockstep with a bullish market.As of August 31, 2022, CDSL has Rs 38.5 trillion as assets in custody, while NSDL managed custodial assets worth Rs 320 trillion. Foreign investors, too, have been making a solid comeback in Indian markets, energising it further. Last month, FIIs invested Rs 51,200 crore in the country's equities. Money is flowing in mutual funds as well, with the industry's average AUM standing at Rs 37,76,911 crore in July 2022, according to AMFI.However, as Indians throng the market, the risks associated with directly investing in stocks also need to be considered. While you can straightforwardly invest in the shares of specific companies you like via your Demat accounts, it needs time, experience, and serious expertise to timely spot them in light of the ongoing macroeconomic trends.While the prospect of skyrocketing and immediate returns may be alluring, take the jump in direct stock investing only if you intricately understand the fundamentals of businesses and markets and have the time to do so.What&amp;#8217;s more, it&amp;#8217;s way more expensive to invest in a single company's stock, meaning that in case the company's fortunes plunge, a significant amount of your savings could be at risk.Mutual funds, on the other hand, delegate this decision-making to an experienced fund manager, who works full-time to manage your funds at a nominal cost. With an amount as low as Rs 500, you can invest in more than one company and diversify your risks across various companies, instead of sticking to a few.As Sanjeev Dawar, veteran financial planner, puts it, 'MFs suit salaried employees and retail investors who can invest a predefined amount each month, commonly known as SIP i.e. systematic/smart investment plan. If one follows a discipline of investing Rs 3000 a month (100 a day) for 30 years, the corpus can reach nearly 1 crore (returns assumed @12%). The total invested amount here is less than 11 lakhs. That's the power of compounding in MFs. Investing through SIP is favourable during volatility as it results in rupee cost averaging. As a fixed amount is invested each month, a lower NAV (unit price of an MF) results in a higher number of units being purchased. A higher NAV on the other hand means a greater fund value of accumulated units.'Read all the Latest Business News and Breaking News here","ભારતમાં ડિમેટ ખાતાઓની સંખ્યા 100 મિલિયનને પાર કરી ગઈ છે, ઓગસ્ટ 2022 માં 100.5 મિલિયન સુધી પહોંચી ગઈ છે. કોવિડ-19 મહામારી પહેલાં 40.9 મિલિયનની આ મહત્વપૂર્ણ વૃદ્ધિ ખાતા ખોલવાની વધતી ગતિને કારણે છે. બુલિશ બજાર અને રોકાણકારોનો વિશ્વાસ ડિમેટ ખાતા ખોલવામાં વૃદ્ધિ દર્શાવે છે. વિદેશી રોકાણકારો પણ ભારતીય બજારમાં પાછા આવી રહ્યા છે અને ઇક્વિટીમાં મહત્વપૂર્ણ રોકાણ કરી રહ્યા છે. હજી સુધી, સીધા સ્ટોકમાં રોકાણ આકર્ષક હોઈ શકે છે, પરંતુ તેમાં જોખમ પણ છે. મ્યુચ્યુઅલ ફંડ વધુ વૈવિધ્યપૂર્ણ અને ખર્ચકારક વિકલ્પ પ્રદાન કરે છે, જેનાથી રોકાણકારો અનુભવી ફંડ મેનેજરોને નિર્ણય લેવાની જવાબદારી સોંપી શકે છે. સિસ્ટમેટિક ઇન્વેસ્ટમેન્ટ પ્લાન્સ (SIP) દ્વારા રોકાણ કરવાથી સમય જતા મહત્વપૂર્ણ વળતર મળી શકે છે."
gujarati_test_63,"The promotional advert for India's long-pending fifth Test against England is a weird one. For some reason, the ad agency and the broadcaster both decided to deem it a 'historic Test'. That is a fallacy, by definition.IND vs ENG 2022: World-class Indian Attack Capable of Putting England to The Pace TestIn sporting terms at least, you can only deem something historic once it has come to pass, and you can measure its significance in lasting terms, unlike the real-world scenario. For example, if you are Robert Oppenheimer and about to test detonate the first-ever atomic bomb, then, in that scenario you already know it is a historic moment. The differentiation, in the context of this Test series, is clear on its own.In simpler terms, if India wins this game, and takes the series 3-1, then yes, it will be deemed a historic Test. It will only be their 10th Test victory on English soil, and only the fourth-ever Test series win since 1971. Historic indeed, but again, not until the last ball has been bowled. Meanwhile, for England to draw this series 2-2, that won't have any historic significance whatsoever.Even so, it doesn't mean that this fifth Test doesn't hold any significance for Indian cricket. Beyond the aforementioned statistics, or the small matter of World Test Championship points, this Test comes as a fork in the road for Indian cricket. In particular, for this current bunch of senior players in the Indian team.Why? Well, India only has six other Tests remaining in this current FTP cycle. Two of those will be played away in Bangladesh (December, 2022) and four more at home against Australia (February-March, 2023). Unless India qualifies for the WTC Final (to be hosted in England) again, this fifth Test will mark the last proper overseas (SENA) challenge for a number of senior players in the current Indian set-up. And, who knows how this Indian Test team will look like in 2024?It is a journey that began back in 2014-15, when Virat Kohli assumed Test captaincy. What was a stand-in role at Adelaide, quickly transformed into a full-time capacity at the Sydney Test, and the change in India's approach towards the longer format was almost instantly visible. 16 out of 40 wins under Kohli's leadership came in overseas conditions. Winning on tours like West Indies and Sri Lanka became a walk-in-the-park.ENG v IND: Who Could Lead India in Rohit's Absence? Virat Would Have Been An Obvious ChoiceOf course, that wasn't enough, and armed with a lethal pace attack, India took the next step. Two series wins in Australia, winning Tests in South Africa and England, it became the norm. You expected India to win in overseas conditions, a far cry from the last decade. Go back further, and even with Sourav Ganguly's Golden Team, the expectation was to fight and maybe win, and not to just win.New Zealand is the one place that flummoxed this Indian team, and even the pacers couldn't work out the winning formula there. It brings back the aforementioned point - will Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami and company get to revisit New Zealand and make amends? Perhaps not, and it brings further spotlight onto this impending fifth Test against England.Roll back four years, and sitting at the post-series press conference at The Oval in 2018, Kohli was in a belligerent mood. Both he and then coach Ravi Shastri were keen to profess how that 4-1 score-line didn't really tell the tale of their English tour. Truth told, it didn't - for all their bluster in many other press conferences, Kohli-Shastri were right to fight their cause. India had played well for most part of the series, and lost by the minimum margins at crucial junctures.The problem with score-lines though is they never tell an iota of the tale, leave alone a full one. Only those who were there will remember that 2018 series for what it was, and when Kohli-Shastri reached the English shores in 2021, they knew it well. To put it simply, India needed to win the Test series in England last year, and they almost did. 2-1 in four Tests - India put on a masterclass of pace bowling, of seizing moments when they mattered, and despite a few batting hiccups, they were poised to win the series in Manchester.Virat Kohli (left) will surely carry Indian batting hopes. (AFP Photo)And then, Covid-19 intervened. Should that fifth Test had gone ahead? It is a disputable topic, and one that has been put to rest. Yet, there is this desolate feeling about it all. Team India was so close to capping off a summit it had tried hard to scale four years prior. Winning in England, after two Test series wins in Australia, would have given Kohli-Shastri the ultimate prop-up in their last Test series together.None of it transpired, and just look how things have changed now. Shastri is not on the scene. Kohli is fighting a lonesome battle against his past glorious self, far away from the spotlight of captaincy. Rohit is in-charge, but fate has played a cruel hand and India's most impressive batter from last summer will miss this crucial fifth Test. Rahul Dravid is the coach now, but his team couldn't get past an ordinary South Africa in January. Jasprit Bumrah is the new (stand-in) Test captain in a must-not-lose game.To say, India is undercooked going into this fifth Test against Brendon McCullum's spirited England would be an understatement. Yet, it isn't far away from the truth. From the outside, it seems a disjointed patched-up squad. The batting is in transition with the likes of Hanuma Vihari and Shreyas Iyer looking to impress. And yet, with Rohit missing, India must rely on Cheteshwar Pujara once again. Kohli needs to be the star man and find his mettle against James Anderson - one last time.It is that key last phrase. Kohli marking his guard, as Anderson gets ready to bowl, four slips in place - a sight for the ages. Surely, it is the last bout for these two heavyweights. How will we remember it, by measures of runs and wickets, or wins and losses? How will Anderson remember it - that he helped England make it 2-2? How will Kohli remember it - will he be able to get across his arch nemesis and help India scale its most-wanted frontier? He may not be captain, but he is still very much the fulcrum of this Test side, more so in Rohit's absence.For Kohli and the likes of Rohit, Pujara, R Ashwin (who surprisingly didn't play a single Test last summer), Ravindra Jadeja, Shami and Umesh Yadav, this is the final step of a long, arduous overseas journey. One, which has seen many ups and downs, some disappointing moments (South Africa 2018 anyone?) and some glorious wonders (Gabba 2021 ahoy!).It is a journey they would want to finish on a winning note - a historic one.Get all the latest updates on Cricket News, Cricket Photos, Cricket Videos and Cricket Scores here","ભારત અને ઇંગ્લેન્ડ વચ્ચેનો પાંચમો ટેસ્ટ મેચ 'ઇતિહાસિક ટેસ્ટ' તરીકે પ્રચારિત કરવામાં આવી રહ્યો છે, પરંતુ તેનો મહત્વ માત્ર તે પૂર્ણ થયા પછી જ નક્કી કરી શકાય. જો ભારત જીતે છે અને શ્રેણી 3-1થી લે છે, તો તે ઇંગ્લેન્ડની જમીન પર તેમનો 10મો ટેસ્ટ વિજય હશે અને 1971 પછીના માત્ર ચોથો ટેસ્ટ શ્રેણી વિજય હશે. આ ટેસ્ટ ભારતીય ટીમના કેટલાક વરિષ્ઠ ખેલાડીઓ માટે છેલ્લી યોગ્ય વિદેશી પડકારીને ચિહ્નિત કરે છે, કારણ કે તેમના પાસે વર્તમાન ચક્રમાં માત્ર છ વધુ ટેસ્ટ બાકી છે. આ મેચ ભારતીય ક્રિકેટ માટે મહત્વપૂર્ણ છે, કારણ કે તે ટીમ માટે લાંબી અને કઠિન મુસાફરીનો કૂલમિનેશન છે."

The Congress leader, however, is no stranger to this role. In 2002, the Congress-led Vilasrao Deshmukh government in Maharashtra was about to collapse. Fearing a defeat, he moved his MLAs to neighbouring Karnataka, ruled by SM Krishna.

Krishna entrusted the responsibility of keeping them safe to his young Urban Development Minister DK Shivakumar. He herded them to Eagleton Resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru and hosted them for a week. On the day of trust vote, he escorted them back to Mumbai and the Vilasrao government survived. And Shivakumar hit the national headlines. That incident also helped him cement his relationship with the Gandhi family.

Shivakumar, known as DKS in Karnataka politics, is an all-weather man for the Congress. He reached the top of state politics by fighting the Gowda family in their stronghold. His prolonged fight with the Gowdas is legendary.

Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga, won his first Assembly election in 1989 from Sathanur in Kanakapura taluk by defeating the giant of Karnataka politics HD Deve Gowda. When S Bangarappa became the CM in 1990, he recognised Shivakumar's talent and made him a junior minister with Prisons and Homeguards portfolio. Even though the portfolio was insignificant, Shivakumar caught the attention of the top brass because of his leadership skills and daring. He was just 29 years old and that mattered a lot.

When Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal came to power in 1994, Shivakumar was one of the very few who survived the storm. He fought a battle with the Gowdas even when Deve Gowda was the PM.

When a fellow Vokkaliga, SM Krishna, became the CM in 1999, he made Shivakumar his Urban Development minister. Shivakumar behaved like de-facto CM, rubbing many top leaders the wrong way. In the 2002 Lok Sabha bypolls, he fought against Deve Gowda from Kanakapura and lost. He took his revenge by defeating Deve Gowda in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls from the same seat by fielding a journalist, Tejaswini, against him.

But the Krishna government lost the Assembly polls held along with Lok Sabha polls. Congress and JD(S) formed a coalition government and Shivakumar was kept out. He had to wait till January 2014 to return to Karnataka Cabinet.

He had held the post of KPCC working president during Yeddyurappa's government. But he was ineffective as the head of Congress.

When Siddaramaiah-led Congress came to power in 2013, Shivakumar was kept out on charges of corruption. But he did not quit the party or say anything against the high command. He was made the Power Minister in January 2014.

Even though he never shared a good rapport with Siddaramaiah, they stuck together because of their common enemy — the Gowdas. There was the occasional bickering, but they worked together.

When the BJP tried to defeat Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel in the Gujarat Rajya Sabha election in August 2017, the same Shivakumar had sheltered Gujarat Congress MLAs. He was raided by the Income Tax and ED, but he did not budge. Ahmed Patel won and Shivakumar had the last laugh.

He missed the chance to become KPCC president in May 2017 because Siddaramaiah saw him as a threat. But he did not utter a word against the party or Siddaramaiah. He was the campaign committee chairman during the last election.

After the elections delivered a fractured mandate, the same Shivakumar joined hands with the Gowda family to keep the BJP out of power. He had kept them at the same Eagleton resort for three days and later took them to Hyderabad by bus. He made sure that no Congress MLA switched sides and even brought two 'missing' MLAs — Pratap Gouda Patil and Anand Singh — back into the party.

Shivakumar is liked and hated in equal measures. He is a polarising personality but his supporters love and admire him because they claim he stands by them during crisis.

His enemies fear him because he is vindictive. He makes no bones about his ambition to be the chief minister of Karnataka before he retires from politics. Speaking to this reporter, he had said that he had won seven Assembly elections in a row and had done a lot for the party which makes him eligible for the post. And most agree with him.","કર્ણાટકના કોંગ્રેસ નેતા ડી.કે. શિવકુમારને કોંગ્રેસ-જેડી(એસ) ગઠબંધન સરકારને પડી પડવાથી બચાવવાનો જવાબ સોંપવામાં આવ્યો છે. આ પહેલી વાર નથી કે તેમને આ જવાબદારી આપવામાં આવી છે, કારણ કે 2002માં તેમણે મહારાષ્ટ્રમાં વિલાસરાવ દેશમુખ સરકારને કર્ણાટકમાં ધારાસભ્યોને ખસેડીને સફળતાપૂર્વક સંરક્ષિત કરી હતી. શિવકુમાર, જેમને ડી.કે.એસ તરીકે ઓળખવામાં આવે છે, ગૌડા પરિવારો સામે લડતનો લાંબો ઇતિહાસ ધરાવે છે અને રાજ્ય સરકારમાં મંત્રી તરીકે પણ સેવા આપી છે. તેમને તેમના વિવાદાસ્પદ વ્યક્તિત્વ માટે પ્રશંસા અને ડર બંને મળે છે અને તેઓ કર્ણાટકના મુખ્યમંત્રી બનવાની મહત્વાકાંક્ષા ધરાવે છે. ઘણા લોકો માનતા છે કે તે આ પદ માટે યોગ્ય છે."
gujarati_test_66,"(Reuters) &amp;#8211; Amazon.com&amp;rsquo;s cloud division has drawn thousands of customers to try out its service vying with Microsoft and Google in a key area of artificial intelligence, an executive told Reuters.The company also announced new AI tools on Wednesday, including a program for building more conversational customer-service agents, technology access from the startup Cohere and a healthcare system for generating clinical notes after a patient visit.Organizations including Sony, Ryanair and Sun Life have tried out Amazon Bedrock, a service the company announced in April that lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, Vice President Swami Sivasubramanian said. Such generative technology can produce new text, images and other content on command.&amp;quot;Our mission is to make every company an AI company,&amp;quot; said Sivasubramanian, in an interview pegged to a summit the cloud provider hosted in New York.Amazon Bedrock is the company&amp;#39;s answer to services announced by Google and Microsoft, cloud rivals that have developed or marketed AI garnering significant public attention. Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, the startup that created ChatGPT and the AI model known as GPT-4.Amazon&amp;#39;s disclosure of thousands of Bedrock users, previously unreported, shows its efforts are attracting interest as well.The company wants to offer a broader range of AI models than peers to win business, including access to updated technology from startups Anthropic and Stability AI, announced Wednesday. Amazon&amp;#39;s role as the largest cloud provider by revenue &amp;#8211; already hosting myriad customers&amp;#39; data &amp;#8211; distinguishes it, too, the company has said.Amazon Bedrock will become available generally to any customer very &amp;quot;soon,&amp;quot; Sivasubramanian said. He declined to state when, adding the company aims to address issues around cost allocation and enterprise controls first.Industry has continued to grapple with the costs of AI more generally. Microsoft on Tuesday reported its highest quarterly capital expenditures since at least its fiscal 2016 as it builds data centers to support AI and battles other cloud companies for key chips from Nvidia.Asked whether Amazon has given businesses with big AI ambitions a deadline to secure chip access, Sivasubramanian said, &amp;quot;We are working with them to ensure we understand their ramp-up schedule.&amp;quot; The company meanwhile widened access to technology it billed as more efficient for training AI, based on Nvidia chips.The cloud provider also previewed Agents for Amazon Bedrock, which lets businesses create chatbots that execute tasks and give more personalized answers drawing from their proprietary data.An airline could build a virtual agent that books a flight for a traveler, for instance, based on a customer&amp;#39;s price, destination and seating requests. The business potential for such agents have recently gripped Silicon Valley.And as part of its AI push, the company made an appeal to the healthcare industry specifically. It announced a service called AWS HealthScribe to let software vendors build apps to transcribe and analyze conversations between a doctor and patient.A unit of 3M plans to use this to speed up clinical documentation, the companies said.","એમેઝોનના ક્લાઉડ વિભાગ, એમેઝોન વેબ સર્વિસિસ (AWS), તેનાં એઆઇ સેવાઓ તરફ હજારો ગ્રાહકોને આકર્ષિત કરી રહી છે, એમ વાઇસ પ્રેસિડેન્ટ સ્વામી શિવસુબ્રમણિયન કહે છે.

Talking to News18, she revealed how she had broken many so-called rules to be here.'I lost my parents at an early age and was raised by my maternal family. After finishing school, I did a two-year electrical course at Industrial Training Institute (ITI), PUSA. In the beginning, when I got placed here, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to work on such huge machines. Barring two or three women, all co-workers were men, who initially were not very supportive of the fact that we'd be working together. Also, I used to face a lot of difficulty in moving machines and lifting heavy equipment. But, I kept at it and now I can repair any old transformer.

gujarati_test_71,"The Congress and other parties are making their last-ditch effort to try to malign the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi knowing fully well that Modi is the country's best bet to fight corruption in government, bureaucracy, politics and various other spheres of public life. The Congress' high-decibel campaign in Karnataka seeks to derail the fight against corruption but it is sure to fail as other similar campaigns have failed earlier.The state is slated to witness the 'Modi magic' once again. The prime minister will launch a full-blown campaign in the last 15 days before the state witness polls. Modi is the lone crusader fighting against corruption and the myth created by the Congress and other Opposition parties would fall flat since the campaign would enable people to see the truth through the anti-corruption prism — the Modi parameters.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tried a similar smear campaign during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on the issue of the Rafale deal but failed desperately. His 'Chowkidar Chor Hai' campaign was stunted and blown to pieces by the slogan 'Mai Bhi Chowkidar' coined by Modi and followed by the BJP workers and his millions of supporters across the world. Rahul's campaign fell like a pack of cards and the Congress could not prevent the BJP from winning more Lok Sabha seats than those in 2014.The Congress' slogan in Karnataka of '40 percent cut government' has emanated from the allegations labelled by the contractors' association that failed to substantiate the allegations. A state CID inquiry into one such allegation of corruption against KS Eshwarappa found no truth in the whole case. But Eshwarappa, who was the Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister, had to resign to save embarrassment to the party.The Congress has committed the mistake of holding on to a slogan that may evoke the laughter of onlookers in a rally but cannot be substantiated. On the contrary, this campaign has given the BJP a handle to browbeat the Congress and talk about its proven track record on corruption. Corruption is not the Congress' strong forte.Not long ago, people had seen the visuals of senior Congress leader, DK Shivakumar, throwing Rs 500 notes at the crowd that had gathered to watch his road show in Mandya last month. Such a naked display of wealth and erosion of political morality put the Congress in the dock. He is a person already maligned. Cases of disproportionate assets have already been registered against him and the high court, last Thursday, rejected his plea against the CBI investigation. He was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in 2019 in a money laundering case. The Income Tax (IT) department found him to be involved in hawala transactions and unearthed unaccounted assets worth crores of Rupees.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is himself facing charges of fraud in the National Herald Case and both he and his mother, Sonia Gandhi, are out on personal bail bond of Rs 50,000 each. The case involves the use of party funds to buy property worth thousands of crores in the name of private individuals. Rahul cannot even talk of vendetta politics here because the lower court has taken cognisance of the case and the higher courts have refused to grant a stay on the proceedings.The list of omissions and commissions by the Congress and other Opposition parties is very long. Leaders of all these parties know that the law will come catching very soon. The prime minister is not just talking about their corruption but has also enacted legislation to strengthen the fight against the loot of the exchequer. Now it is becoming increasingly difficult to own benami property or save money in the bank without an address or accountability. The IT-enabled systems of administrative checks would help track such properties.Earlier, people used to buy assets abroad without the fear of being caught. Some even shifted outside to escape the law. But now, it is not possible, since such properties can easily be confiscated if the source of money is proven to be corruption or fraud. It has become easier to track financial crimes.And those who ask why the BJP leaders are not getting caught should know that the law applies equally to all. Those in the know of things know that it is very difficult to make money using government power. The way Modi is keeping an eye on ministers and MPs, very soon there would be no premium on becoming MPs or MLAs or ministers. Those who took politics to be a shortcut to becoming rich would be disillusioned.Till now, the Opposition has not been able to come up with a single case where it can show any minister making money due to his office or influence. There may be talks of corruption to create an impression that the Modi government or other state governments run by the BJP are equally bad. But there's not an iota of evidence.The Congress should learn from its past experience that it can't catch Modi on the wrong foot. Ever since Gujarat days, the Congress has been trying to put Modi on the back foot. They had come up with various allegations of corruption and favouritism including undue favours to some business houses. Modi had set up a judicial commission to probe the allegations and nothing was found to be true.The same is going to be the case of high-voltage allegations of favouring the Adanis. Modi, while taking decisions, knows that he would come under public scrutiny. He formulates a policy and the structure and anyone who qualifies gets the government contract. The policy is not twisted for anyone because he has none to favour. What is good for the country is good for him.People know that Modi is not corrupted and hence, cannot be manipulated. This is the reason why he still stands tall. He has the trust of the people with him, unlike others, who talk big about fighting corruption but do secret deals in the closets. The Karnataka victory of the BJP would bear the Modi stamp and embolden the decisive fight against corruption.The writer is the convener of the media relations department of the BJP and represents the party as a spokesperson on TV debates.

The ongoing conflict has led to over 90 deaths, including civilians from both warring communities.Following Union Home Minister Amit Shah&amp;#8217;s visit to the troubled state, a three-tier Unified Command under State Security Advisor Kuldeep Singh was established to restore normalcy. Chief Minister N Biren Singh paid tribute to a slain BSF soldier.Army Operations in Sugnu &amp;#038; SerouThe Army reported multiple incidents of violence, arson, and firing in Sugnu and Serou, leading to the redeployment of additional troops in the area over the past 48 hours. The troops were assigned to strengthen ongoing area domination operations, conduct ambushes, and prevent further violence and arson.According to the Army, &amp;#8220;Intermittent exchange of fire took place between security forces and insurgents during the night of 5th and 6th June as a result of extensive area domination operations. Security forces took measures to prevent insurgents from escaping. However, firing intensified in the early hours, resulting in fatal injuries to one BSF personnel. Two Assam Rifles personnel were wounded and evacuated to Imphal. Initial reports suggest casualties among the insurgents, which are currently being verified.

They emphasise their demand for a separate administration of hill areas in Manipur during future peace talks with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).However, the World Meitei Council expresses skepticism about the ground situation and questions whether the Kuki militants have returned to their designated camps as requested by the Union Home Minister. The Council raises concerns about the government&amp;#8217;s inability to contain the situation and demands an investigation into the 10 MLAs who have called for separate administration.As per certain reports, Manipur has witnessed a loss of 98 lives, with approximately 40,000 people seeking refuge in 272 relief camps and others fleeing to neighbouring states and Myanmar.Nabakishore Yumnam, National Spokesperson of the World Meitei Council, highlights the issue of Kuki illegal migrants engaging in poppy cultivation in Manipur and challenges their claims of persecution.

gujarati_test_74,"As protesting farmers turned rioters on Tuesday in New Delhi, the name of actor Deep Sidhu emerged at the forefront of the desecration that happened at the Red Fort. While farmer unions alleged it was 'fringe elements' like him who instigated protesters and turned the agitation violent, Sidhu defended his actions, saying they did not remove the national flag at the Red Fort, but only put up the &amp;#8216;Nishan Sahib&amp;#8217; as a symbolic protest.The violent turn of events after two months of farmers&amp;#8217; agitation has exposed the movement, even as unions and leaders continue to disassociate themselves from the faction that stormed the Red Fort.While there have been calls for an investigation into the role of Sidhu and Lakhana Sidhana in Tuesday's violence, there have been unfounded and unconfirmed reports linking the former to the BJP and the party's MP Sunny Deol. Deol has categorically denied having any connection with Siddhu, who himself has said that he does not have any association with the BJP.Who is Deep Sidhu?Sidhu was born in 1984 in Punjab&amp;#8217;s Muktsar district.

They opposed the route agreed upon between SKM leaders and Delhi Police, and their call was also webcast live on some Punjabi web channels and individual social media accounts.While it was first unknown faces who took up the state, Lakhbir Singh Sidhana alias Lakha Sidhana, 40, and Sidhu later addressed the crowd. Sidhana is a gangster-turned-politician and president of the Malwa Youth Federation, Indian Express reports.Sidhu had also held a prolonged protest at Shambu border between Punjab and Haryana before moving to Singhu border. Accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests at Shambu have also been previously made.Reports say he was also involved in breaking barriers at Shambu border in November last year, after which Haryana Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the group of protesting farmers trying to enter Delhi. Sidhu and his brother, Mandeep Singh, were also among those summoned by the NIA earlier in January in connection with a case filed against the banned outfit &amp;#8216;Sikhs For Justice&amp;#8217;.Sidhana was acquitted in several cases before contesting the 2012 assembly polls as a candidate of the People's Party of Punjab, floated by Manpreet Singh Badal.Unfounded linksActor and BJP MP Sunny Deol has distanced himself from Sidhu in December last year after the latter joined the farmers' agitation. In a tweet, Deol on Tuesday said, 'Today, I am very sad to see what happened on the Red Fort, I have already made it clear on Twitter, on 6 December, that I or my family has no connection with Deep Sidhu.'Sidhu, himself, in an interview to a journalist has clearly mentioned that he was never been part of the BJP or supported the party.

Along with this, the government is also implementing cluster development programme (CDP) to leverage geographical specialisation of horticulture clusters and promote integrated and market-led development of pre-production, production, post-harvest, logistics, branding and marketing activities.

gujarati_test_76,"After a certain age, men and women, especially those with sedentary lifestyles, often get a paunch. They join gym, and tell the trainer, 'I will be fit if I could just get rid of this bulge. Please tell me exercises that could remove this.' A good trainer replies that there is no such thing as spot reduction. 'Although targeting fat loss in specific areas of the body would be ideal, the theory of spot reduction has not been proven effective by scientific studies,' says the popular website Healthline.com. Getting rid of paunch—or fat from any other part of the body—is not an isolated task; it involves a complete change in lifestyle. From physical activity to diet to sleep to vice control—everything has to undergo a sea change. And if you can do that, the results would be comprehensive—better metabolism, higher immunity, healthier heart, etc. You would get much more than a flat stomach.Unemployment is a similar problem: it cannot be eliminated or reduced by just targeting it. Like tummy reduction, job creation is also contingent upon a comprehensive set of actions, most of which are well-known: easier and fewer compliances, light regulation, predictable policies, flexible labour laws, limited state intervention in the economy, a benign administration, a good law and order situation.Government can't play God to employment. It can't say, 'Let there be employment, and there was employment.' Being a product and function of human contrivance, government can and must do what is humanly possible; and all the prerequisite actions mentioned in the previous paragraph are within the realm of possibility. These actions also go by the name of economic reforms. The government must focus on them.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said more than once that she is committed to reforms. In her 2021-22 Budget speech, she hit the nail on the head by highlighting the role of manufacturing in employment generation, for the sector has huge employment potential. She had said in her Budget speech, 'For a $5-trillion economy, our manufacturing sector has to grow in double digits on a sustained basis. Our manufacturing companies need to become an integral part of global supply chains, possess core competence and cutting-edge technology. To achieve all of the above, PLI schemes to create manufacturing global champions for an Atmanirbhar Bharat have been announced for 13 sectors. For this, the government has committed nearly Rs 1.97 lakh crore, over 5 years starting FY 2021-22. This initiative will help bring scale and size in key sectors, create and nurture global champions and provide jobs to our youth.'Unfortunately, manufacturing has been shrinking since 2011-12. Its share in the country's gross value added (GVA) has come down from 17.4 per cent in 2011-12 to 14.5 per cent in 2020-21. In this fiscal too, despite the government's package, manufacturing hasn't done wonders. It grew by 18.5 per cent in the April-November period, but this was against -17.2 per cent in the corresponding period last fiscal.There are three things that the government should do in earnest; there is also something that it should not do. We begin with what it shouldn't do: it should not set up a committee to look into the issues that plague factories and employment. There is enough expertise and wisdom already available; it just needs to be put to use.The government, under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, had approved a National Manufacturing Policy in November 2011 'with the objective of enhancing the share of manufacturing in GDP (gross domestic product) to 25 per cent within a decade and creating 100 million jobs.'Evidently, that hasn't happened. The Narendra Modi government can strive to attain these objectives; it can even garner, if it tries hard, bipartisan support for the implementation of the policy.First, in formulating and executing policies, there should be more inputs from and involvement of India Inc. The economy cannot be left in the hands of economists, experts, politicians, and bureaucrats; the stakeholders ought to have a greater say.Second, Nirmala Sitharaman's ministry has to clear the GST mess, which has been caused mainly because of variable rates. This is a source of trouble for small entrepreneurs.And finally, the government has to lessen the fear of agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax department. An industrialist can get a few visitations from these dreaded departments just because his son or daughter posted something nasty about some politician or government on social media.Unsurprisingly, rich Indians are leaving the country. According to a study by AfrAsia Bank, 7,000 high net worth individuals (HNWIs) left India in 2019. India ranked second in the list of HNWIs leaving their native country; China topped the list.

gujarati_test_77,"Oommen Chandy was hardly ever seen without a smile. The two-time chief minister, endearingly called &amp;#8220;Kunjoonju&amp;#8221; or OC by friends and followers, was always known to be a &amp;#8220;people&amp;#8217;s man&amp;#8221;. Once during an informal meeting I had as a reporter with Chandy, he shared a very interesting anecdote during his mass contact programme (Jana Samparkka Paripadi). He had decided to spend 100 days receiving people&amp;#8217;s grievances and suggestions over phone calls on Doordarshan Keralam.&amp;#8220;You know, I received a very interesting call. A man whose cow had not been providing milk for several weeks. He was a farmer, and his family&amp;#8217;s livelihood depended on it. He asked me to find a solution that would make his cow give milk. It may sound ridiculous to you that he asked a chief minister that. But it was a very important issue for him. I immediately called the veterinary department and asked them to address the matter,&amp;#8221; he said with his evergreen smile.Such was the man that he even followed up on the issue to find out about the welfare of the cow and the farmer&amp;#8217;s family. This was just a glimpse of the political leader whose people-connect programme was recognised by the United Nations.Not the typical family manA tweet from Oommen Chandy&amp;#8217;s son, Chandy Oommen, saying &amp;#8220;Appa is no more&amp;#8221; also marked the end of a chapter of an illustrious career and stalwart in Kerala&amp;#8217;s politics. Throughout his life, Chandy remained a tireless and revered Congress leader in Kerala, consistently putting the welfare of the people at the forefront of his endeavours.Chandy Oommen once spoke to a Kerala-based newspaper and talked about how his father worked 24&amp;#215;7, without caring about his health. He also said that he rarely saw his father during his early childhood as the leader would spend hours travelling across the state addressing people&amp;#8217;s issues and leading agitations that have been marked as major milestones in Kerala&amp;#8217;s politics.&amp;#8220;When he was the chief minister, he declared his 100-day programme. He remained awake till 2 am and signed the files. Again he would get up in the morning at 4 and start sitting before the files. This he continued, giving little importance to his health. One day, I hid this file. Early in the morning he came and stood in front of me while I was sleeping. He worriedly asked, &amp;#8216;Where are those files?&amp;#8217; It was the time when I felt guilty and ashamed,&amp;#8221; Chandy Oommen had told Kerala Kaumudi in an interview a few years ago when his father completed 50 years as a politician.Stood by the phone during Tikrit crisisIn June 2014, as war ravaged Iraq, 46 Indian nurses were being held in captivity by terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the city of Tikrit. They were being held hostage for 23 days while the civil war raged between the Iraqi government forces and ISIS.With luck on my side, I was able to get the contacts of a few of the nurses who had been held hostage and kept in touch to understand the situation as well as keep a tab on their well-being. As the day progressed, the war intensified, and the nurses feared for their lives. I would sit by my phone each night to monitor the situation due to the 2.5-hour time difference between Tikrit and India. The nurses would often call me in distress as they heard parts of their hospital being bombed.I recall the days when Merina, one of the stranded nurses who was also in touch with the Indian and Kerala authorities who were working out a safe passage for their return, said to me over the phone, &amp;#8220;I wish that they rescue us soon. We don&amp;#8217;t think we will live to see another day. Please ask the government to help us.&amp;#8221; Then the phone disconnected as their mobile ran out of charge.The panic was palpable, and I would also send updates to the officials of a 24&amp;#215;7 helpline set up under the state NRK agency Norka to provide updated information on the situation. Oommen Chandy would sit by the phones to personally monitor the progress.One night, at around 3.30 am, I received a phone call from Shivadas, one of Chandy&amp;#8217;s trusted colleagues.&amp;#8220;Chandy sir wants to speak to you,&amp;#8221; he said in a matter-of-fact tone. The next thing I heard was the CM&amp;#8217;s voice, who in a very calm manner asked me, &amp;#8220;Do you have any latest updates on the nurses? I hear some of them saying they are in touch with you and trust you.&amp;#8221; Though I was taken aback, I briefed him based on my notes. He quickly asked me to keep his office updated.When the nurses were safely brought back home with the intervention of then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and the Indian ambassador in Iraq Ajay Kumar, he acknowledged several people who were of immense help in the evacuation of the nurses.Soon after, Chandy met me at his office in Thiruvananthapuram and smiled. &amp;#8220;I have to thank you for the way you kept us posted, and it&amp;#8217;s not just us, but you too have a role to play in saving those nurses&amp;#8217; lives. I heard you would speak to them and give them the strength to fight. I commend that.&amp;#8221;What else can a reporter ask? It was not pride that I felt, but admiration for the man who, despite being the CM, was a symbol of humility and genuineness.The next day, Chandy said, &amp;#8220;I am a strong believer in God and in prayers. I owe this rescue to the prayers offered by the lakhs of people and the grit and determination of these 46 nurses,&amp;#8221; while receiving a thumping applause from all leaders in the Kerala assembly.Knew his constituents by nameOnce when I visited his humble home in Kottayam&amp;#8217;s Puthuppally, there was a huge rush of people waiting to see him. The then former CM patiently met each and every one of them while sipping on a glass of ragi-based drink.&amp;#8220;I cannot stand to be alone. I have the company of people. It is what keeps me alive and kicking,&amp;#8221; he told this reporter.Chandy had named his Puthuppally Thiruvananthapuram residence &amp;#8220;Puthuppally&amp;#8221;, a home that his wife Mariamma bought with the help of a bank loan. This was his way to mark his respect to all his constituents who ensured he never faced defeat from the Puthupally seat.He knew most of the people by their names, and that personal connection made him a politician with a difference.Despite efforts from the CPM to unseat him from his bastion Puthupally by fielding veterans and influential leaders like VN Vasavan, Reji Zachariah, Cherian Philip, Susan George, among others in over 11 consecutive elections, all efforts were in vain.Undisputed leaderHaving been elected for the first time at the young age of 27 in 1970, he had since retained the seat in the years 1977, 1980, 1982, 1987, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2021 until his health did not permit him to travel around as he was diagnosed with cancer.Until 2021, Oommen Chandy never owned a house of his own. It was only in that year that the construction of his new home had begun. His final journey and remains will be kept for the public to pay their respects in the new house under construction, local Congress leaders say.During one of the interactions I had with the people of Puthuppally during the elections in 2011, they all said in unison, &amp;#8220;He does not need to campaign in this seat. We will always vote in favour of Oommen Chandy. We wish that he travels across the state and helps people who need it more and also strengthens the Congress in Kerala.&amp;#8221;Born on October 31, 1943, in Puthuppally, Kerala, Chandy delved into active politics at a very young age with the Kerala Students Union (KSU). He was popular even then as a student activist, who wanted to work from the grassroots level towards public welfare. Over the years, he rose in the ranks of the Congress and handled important portfolios like home and finance of the state cabinet. In 2004, he first got the opportunity to take charge as the chief minister of Kerala when AK Antony stepped down after the Congress poll debacle in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.Welfare programmesChandy&amp;#8217;s impactful leadership earned him two terms as Kerala chief minister. During his first tenure (2004-2006), he endeared himself to the masses with initiatives like unemployment allowances and labour welfare programmes. In his second term (2011-2016), he launched the innovative &amp;#8220;Mass Contact Programme&amp;#8221;, fostering direct communication with the public to understand their needs.Based on the feedback from this programme, he introduced social welfare pensions, subsidised ration schemes, and poverty-alleviation measures, positively impacting the lives of many. Chandy&amp;#8217;s commitment to the welfare of the people and visionary approach left a lasting legacy in Kerala&amp;#8217;s history.Despite facing political controversies, such as the infamous solar scandal and bar bribery cases, Chandy displayed remarkable political acumen by skillfully guiding the UDF (United Democratic Front) through turbulent times, ultimately securing a narrow victory in the assembly elections. Late last year, the CBI also gave him a clean chit in the sexual exploitation allegation levelled by Saritha Nair, prime accused in the Kerala solar scam case.Throughout his life, Chandy remained an indefatigable and highly respected Congress leader in Kerala, consistently prioritising the welfare of the people in all his endeavours. He leaves behind his wife, Mariamma, and three children - Maria Oommen, Chandy Oommen, and Achu Oommen.&amp;#8216;It&amp;#8217;s election time. Keep me in your prayers&amp;#8217;Recently, his wife Mariamma penned an emotional and heartwarming story of how she received a letter from Oommen Chandy who, at the time, was her prospective bridegroom. Their marriage was fixed just before an election. She thought it would be a love letter that he wrote to her. When she opened it, it carried two lines - 'It&amp;#8217;s election time. Keep me in your prayers.'She prayed hard that he would win the election, the second one of his political career. &amp;#8220;I did not want people to say his new bride brought him ill luck.&amp;#8221;Clearly, she turned out to be his lucky charm and his soulmate who not only remained by his side through thick and thin but also kept their family together despite Oommen Chandy being hardly at home.","ઉમન ચાંડી, કેરળના પૂર્વ મુખ્યમંત્રી, તેમના લોકો-કેન્દ્રિત અભિગમ અને જાહેર કલ્યાણ માટેની અવિરત પ્રતિબદ્ધતા માટે જાણીતા હતા. તેઓ વ્યક્તિગત રીતે લોકોની ફરિયાદોનું નિરાકરણ કરતા અને મુદ્દાઓના નિરાકરણ માટે અનુસરો કરતા. ચાંડીનું નેતૃત્વ તે સંકટ દરમિયાન ઉદાહરણરૂપ હતું જ્યારે આઈએસઆઈએસએ ઈરાકમાં ભારતીય નર્સોને બંદી બનાવી હતી. તેમણે વ્યક્તિગત રીતે પરિસ્થિતિ પર નજર રાખી અને તેમની સલામત વાપસી માટે પ્રયત્ન કર્યો. રાજકીય વિવાદો છતાં, ચાંડીની લોકોના કલ્યાણ માટેની પ્રતિબદ્ધતા અને તેમના દુરંદેશી ઉપક્રમો, જેમ કે માસ કોન્ટેક્ટ પ્રોગ્રામ, એક સ્થીર અસર છોડી. તેમના નિધન પામ્યા, પરંતુ તેઓ નમ્રતા અને લોકો માટેની સાચી ચિંતા ની વારસો છોડી ગયા."

gujarati_test_79,"India is a key partner of the United Kingdom and the two countries are negotiating a new trade agreement, British foreign secretary Liz Truss told CNN-News18 in an interview during her India visit on Thursday. The UK is cutting down on its strategic dependence on Russia and China and it wants to work more with friends like India, said Truss, who was in New Delhi the same day as her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Edited excerpts:https://twitter.com/CNNnews18/status/1509535583852503045?t=oE35yUpJiHe1Zh6yrf28YA&amp;amp;s=19This is your second visit in six months to India and this time you come with a clear message, I understand, on the Ukraine issue. What message have you communicated to the Indian side as far as Russia is concerned and how has it been received?The reason I?m here in India is that the Indian relationship is very important to the UK. We see India as a key partner. We want to work much more closely together in areas like technology, negotiating trade agreements. We want to work more closely in areas like energy, security and defence, and the situation in Russia and Ukraine has shattered European security. We?re in a different world now, we?re in a more insecure world, and this time it is vital that we work with our friends to improve our mutual security. And that?s what I?m here in India to talk about today.I understand that there was a message that you wanted to communicate to the Indian side as far as reducing the dependencies on Russia is concerned. Is there anything specific that you communicated on that?Well, I think we need to look at our reliance on overseas authoritarian countries. We?re doing that in the United Kingdom. We don?t want to be strategically dependent on the countries we cannot rely on. We are doing more to make sure we produce at home, but we are doing more to make sure that we work with trusted partners. And these are the discussions that we are having with India about how can the UK and India improve our domestic resilience, how can we ensure, for example, in areas like defence and energy, that we are not dependent on other countries, that we don?t have a single point of failure, if you like, in terms of supplies of whether it is critical mineral, and energy. And this is something that India and the United Kingdom can work on.But India has already shown its intention to buy the discounted oil from Russia. Did that come up in the discussion?I am not going to interfere in India?s sovereign decisions, but we all recognise that we need to make sure that we are able to be resilient and make independent sovereign decisions. What the Russia-Ukraine crisis has shown is that Europe in particular is far too dependent on Russian oil and gas. And that has enabled Vladimir Putin to fund his war machine in Ukraine, but it has also enabled him to cross countries in Europe, and I think we have recognised that there is a cost to be paid for having cheap goods, and cheap oil and gas. So the UK is looking to ban Russian oil from the UK by the end of this year. We?re looking to reduce our dependence. We have put sanctions on the Russian economy, but we also want to reduce our strategic dependence on China. We want to rely on the partners that we trust. And one of the partners that we can trust is India.But I understand that many European countries have not been very happy or rather been unhappy with India?s stand with regards to Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council or the UN platforms. Why isn?t India?s position viewed as neutral by the European countries? I mean, after all, India abstained from a resolution backed by Russia last week as well. And India has shown intention that it wants to keep its foreign policy independent and sovereign.We are very clear that Russia has violated Ukraine?s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and that should worry countries across the world. Because if authoritarian regimes are allowed to do that, if an aggressor is allowed to get away with that, then that sends a terrible signal to other aggressors around the world. And that?s why the UK has taken a very strong stand, in terms of being the first European country to supply weapons to Ukraine to help them defend themselves, in terms of putting the toughest possible sanctions on Russia. But I recognise that as a sovereign decision of the UK, we want to improve our resilience, we want to eliminate any dependence on Russia, we want to reduce our dependence on authoritarian regimes, and I know that India and other countries around the world are looking to improve their domestic resilience, and that is what I?m here in India to talk about today.Yesterday, PM Modi at the BIMSTEC summit had spoken about how the Ukraine crisis has raised questions over the international order. The Japanese prime minister has also spoken about the crisis saying that it has shaken the roots of international order. How do we get back stability in the international order? Was that a point of discussion as well?I think that is absolutely correct. This crisis has shattered European security. We would have never expected in our lifetime that we would have seen this war taking place in Europe. And it does raise questions about defence spending; we are now saying that European countries step up in terms of defence spending. It raises questions about economic security, energy security and it also raises questions about overall global security, because this is just not restricted to the Euro-Atlantic. When a sovereign nation is invaded, and this is why we need to make sure that Putin loses in Ukraine, this can not be a suggestion to other aggressors around the world that this is something that will be normalised, or acceptable because that will have a devastating effect on global security. And this is why countries like Japan have joined the UK in putting sanctions on Russia because they recognise a cause in the issue, as this is also an issue about the respect for the territorial integrity of a nation that every country in the world can get behind.Do you think that the Ukraine crisis has changed the relations between India and the European countries, India and the UK? Because last time you had underlined that there is growing understanding between India and the UK as far as security-related issues are concerned.I think that this global security crisis will result in the UK and India working more closely together because our interests are aligned, we are both democracies, we both believe in sovereignty and territorial integrity. We haven?t done enough together in the past, and I think that this gives fresh impetus to us working more closely whether it is technology, whether it is on defence, or trade. Trade negotiations are taking place, we want that to be accelerated. So that we can improve the economic relations between the UK and India.You didn?t sound very hopeful when the talks were going on between Ukraine and Russia in Turkey. You, in fact, warned that Ukraine could be shortchanged. Where is that apprehension coming from?I don?t believe that the Russians are serious about the talks until they withdraw their troops from Ukraine. The fact is while they?re claiming that they?re a part of negotiations, at the same time, they are shelling innocent civilians in Ukraine. That is appalling, and we will take those talks seriously only when Vladimir Putin withdraws his troops from Ukraine. I don?t see how the Ukrainians are expected to negotiate with guns to their heads.Are we likely to finalise an interim deal by the April end, because that was the timeline that was set, and a final deal by the year-end? Are we going by that timeline now?Increased trade between India and the UK is very important. There is so much that we have in common, there is so much that we can work on. So I want to see as rapid progress as possible. This is why I am doing my third visit to India because this is a very important relationship for us and we?re going to push as hard as we can to get the best possible deal that will benefit the people of the UK and the people of India.Read all the Latest News India and Breaking News here","બ્રિટિશ વિદેશ સચિવ લિઝ ટ્રસે ભારતની મુલાકાત દરમિયાન જણાવ્યું હતું કે યુકે ભારતને મુખ્ય ભાગીદાર તરીકે જુએ છે અને ટેકનોલોજી, વેપાર કરારો, ઊર્જા, સુરક્ષા અને રક્ષા જેવા ક્ષેત્રોમાં નજીકથી કામ કરવા માગે છે. ટ્રસે રશિયા અને ચીન જેવા સત્તાવાદી દેશો પર નિર્ભરતા ઘટાડવાની અને ભારત જેવા વિશ્વસનીય ભાગીદારો સાથે કામ કરીને સ્થાનિક લોકશાહી સુધારવાની જરૂરિયાત પર ભાર મૂક્યો. રશિયાથી ડિસ્કાઉન્ટેડ તેલ ખરીદવાની ભારતની મન્સાને સ્વીકારીને, ટ્રસે યુરોપની રશિયન તેલ અને ગેસ પરની નિર્ભરતા ઘટાડવાની મહત્વતાને રેખાંકિત કરી. તેમણે ભવિષ્યમાં યુકે અને ભારતના વધુ નજીકના સહકાર વિશે આશાવાદ વ્યક્ત કર્યો."

gujarati_test_81,"Following up on last year's frankly very versatile Gel Nimbus 21, Asics must have had to put in a rather generous amount of effort to up the game. As they have done. And it's the 22nd iteration of Asics' legacy Nimbus line, and the latest running shoe is called the Gel Nimbus 22. In fact, what I am reviewing here is the newer of the newest shoe! It is the Asics Gel Nimbus 22 Tata Mumbai Marathon Edition. It is priced at Rs 13,999.

For starters, the Asics Gel Nimbus 22 immediately looks better than its predecessor. The looks bit could also be subjective, and the Asics Gel Nimbus 21 was quite conventional in its own right, but the visual cues come together better this time around. It could perhaps be the vertical flex grooves on the midsole which are visible all around that simply add a dash of personality as well as the 'this means business' look. The electric blue/vibrant yellow colorway is bright, to put it diplomatically. I am more a fan of the sheet rock/graphite grey colorway that the standard Gel Nimbus 22 get. But well, if you like blue and a dash of yellow, these sneakers tick off your checklist for sure. For me, it would have been perfect if Asics had gone with that colorway and then added whatever it needed for the Tata Mumbai Marathon special edition. The 19.0760 degrees north coordinates are embedded quite attractively too—these are the exact coordinates for the location of the Tata Mumbai Marathon and may be a helpful reminder in case you forget. As for your friends and family who may wonder what this is, you can always tell them some complicated explanation that will leave them looking at your shoe in amazement.

The Gel Nimbus shoes have traditionally be neutral shoes, designed for high mileage. They are equally adept as running shoes, and as training shoes. The Gel Nimbus 22 has a 10mm offset (heel height at 25mm and toe height at 15mm). It weighs 309 grams, which though not the lightest, isn't really a matter for concern because these sneakers are very well balanced. The upper is made from a monofilament mesh which is smoother than before, is more flexible, offers more ventilation than before and is also lighter than what the predecessor offered. The additional room inside becomes apparent as soon as you slide your foot in. The toe box is wider, and though I'm not certain about the exact numbers, the vertical height also seems to be more at the front of the shoe.



One thing that I had noticed about the Gel Nimbus 21 was that the midsole had the tendency to feel a tad more robust in the first few seconds after you slip your feet in but softened up quite considerably after that. The comfort was very good, and the feedback from the running surface (be it a soft surface outdoors, a hard floor or a treadmill), was quite appreciable. In the Gel Nimbus 21, beneath your feet was the FlyteFoam Lite midsole which is made of nano-fibres and the springy Flytefoam Propel.

But a lot has changed with the Gel Nimbus 22. This grows up to get the full FlyteFoam experience, complete with 2 millimeters more of the cushioning compared with the predecessor. Asics also says that this now sits closer to the running surface, which allows for quicker and deeper compression as the foot hits the ground. In my experience, the feedback and the bounciness is certainly a notch above what the predecessor offered. Somehow, the foot also feels like it is wrapped in a more luxurious box than before, which is a great thing. The foot remains securely locked in, without ever feeling pressure from the sidewalls.

Most certainly, one of the reasons for this extra dose of luxury is the rather large section of GEL cushioning that sits under the heel. This specifically helps in absorbing the impacts that would otherwise come jarring upwards all the way to your calf muscle. What I can say with certainty is that having used the Asics Gel Quantum Infinity for over a year now, this GEL based cushioning really works in taking the comfort level a couple of notches higher. Though the Infinity had the GEL cushioning through and through, the advantages even under the heel are quite apparent and something you'll really enjoy in the long term.



The outsole is made of what Asics calls as AHAR. It is basically Asics High Abrasion Rubber material. Well, simply put, its rubber. There are now more curvy grooves, 8 in total, which are embedded in the outsole. This is certainly more than the forward focused grooves that the Gel Nimbus 21 has. Grip levels are good, even on the slightly dodgy surfaces just after a sharp shower. What this outsole also helps Asics do is manage the weight of the shoe even after the addition of the new GEL pod and the extra thickness of the midsole. The men's shoe weighs 309 grams, at par with the 310 grams that the Gel Nimbus 21 offered.

It has to be said that Asics have really nailed down the design, comfort and the technology aspects in the Gel Nimbus 22. This adds a genuine dose of premium-ness to the Nimbus line of sneakers. This is a very consistent sneaker that can with you for long distance running, sessions in the gym, training routine and even daily usage—and that's the versatility ticked off. In style.

And as a final reminder, the Tata Mumbai Marathon is being organized on January 19, 2020. The marathon covers a distance of 42.195 km, while the half marathon is 21.097 km. There is a 10k race category as well, and a 5.9 km dream run.","એડિડાસ અલ્ટ્રા બૂસ્ટ 22, એડિડાસની વારસાની અલ્ટ્રા બૂસ્ટ લાઇનમાં તાજેતરની ઉમેરો, તેના પૂર્વજથી દૃશ્ય અપગ્રેડ છે. આ આવૃત્તિ આકર્ષક ઇલેક્ટ્રિક બ્લૂ/જીવંત પીળા રંગના આયોજન સાથે છે અને તેમાં ટાટા મુંબઈ મેરાથોનના સ્થાનાંક દર્શાવવામાં આવ્યા છે. આ એક ન્યૂટ્રલ શૂ છે, જે ઉચ્ચ માઇલેજ માટે ડિઝાઇન કરવામાં આવ્યું છે, અને તેનો વજન લગભગ 309 ગ્રામ છે. આ જૂતામાં મોનોફિલામેન્ટ મેશ અપ્પર છે અને વધારાના વેન્ટિલેશન અને આરામ માટે વિશાળ પગના બોક્સ છે. અલ્ટ્રા બૂસ્ટ 22 ફ્લાઇટફોમ ટેકનોલોજીનો ઉપયોગ કરે છે, જેમાં વધારાની કૂશનિંગ સાથે ઉન્નત દોડવાનો અનુભવ છે. એડિડાસ હાઈ એબ્રેઝન રબર સામગ્રીમાંથી બનેલો આઉટસોલ સ્લીપરિ સપાટીઓ પર પણ સારી પકડ આપે છે."

gujarati_test_84,"Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, has recently unveiled a striking &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; logo that will replace Twitter&amp;#8217;s iconic blue bird. The move marks a major rebranding initiative for the social media giant, which Musk acquired for a staggering $44 billion last year.The transition to the new &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; logo has already begun, with the emblem appearing at the top of Twitter&amp;#8217;s desktop version. However, the blue bird remains dominant on the smartphone app. At Twitter&amp;#8217;s San Francisco headquarters, workers were observed removing the well-known bird and logo. However, their efforts were halted by the police due to the lack of proper permits and safety measures to protect pedestrians.A worker uses a smartphone while dismantling a Twitter&amp;#8217;s sign at Twitter&amp;#8217;s corporate headquarters building as Elon Musk renamed Twitter as X and unveiled a new logo, in downtown San Francisco, California, U.S., July 24, 2023. REUTERS/Carlos BarriaAs the &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; starts to make its mark, it represents more than just a logo change,  as per a report by Associated Press. It signifies a transformative period for Twitter since Musk&amp;#8217;s acquisition.Analyst Jasmine Enberg from Insider Intelligence told AP that the rebranding marks the end of an era, signifying that the Twitter of the past 17 years will not return. Musk&amp;#8217;s vision of turning Twitter into platform &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; has been evident from the start, and the platform has already undergone significant changes, leaving behind its former self.Changing Twitter Left Trails of XThe continuous changes under Musk&amp;#8217;s leadership have stirred mixed reactions among users and advertisers, making Twitter vulnerable to new competition like Meta&amp;#8217;s innovative text-based app Threads, designed to lure Twitter users away.Musk sought inspiration from fans for the new logo and eventually selected a minimalist Art Deco design, which he plans to refine further. Displaying his commitment to the rebranding, Musk replaced his own Twitter icon with a white &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; against a black background. He even shared an image of the design projected on Twitter&amp;#8217;s San Francisco headquarters.In his tweet, Musk hinted at bidding farewell to the Twitter brand and gradually phasing out the iconic blue birds. The &amp;#8220;X.com&amp;#8221; web domain now redirects users to Twitter.com, signifying the beginning of the platform&amp;#8217;s transition towards &amp;#8220;X.&amp;#8221;What is &amp;#8216;X&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8217; Future Now?As Musk steers Twitter towards his grand vision of creating an &amp;#8220;everything app,&amp;#8221; the platform&amp;#8217;s future is uncertain. While the rebranding represents Musk&amp;#8217;s determination to push boundaries, it has also generated mixed feelings among users and advertisers.The journey ahead will be closely monitored to see how &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; shapes Twitter&amp;#8217;s trajectory in the dynamic world of social media.&amp;#8216;Selfish Decision&amp;#8217;'I can't say I'm surprised, but I think it's a very selfish decision,' Hannah Thoreson of Baltimore, Maryland, who&amp;#8217;s used Twitter since 2009 for work and personal posts, told Associated Press.'There are so many small businesses and so many nonprofits and so many government agencies and things like that all around the world that have relied on Twitter for many years to push their message and reach people,&amp;#8221; she said. 'And they all have the Twitter icon on everything from their website to their business cards.'Changing all this costs time and money, she added, not to mention the confusion that comes with a previously unknown brand name.'I mean, do you want to get rid of the Coca-Cola brand if you're Coca-Cola? Why would you do that?' said Thoreson, who now primarily uses Mastodon.Why X?Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has long held a fascination with the letter &amp;#8220;X,&amp;#8221; leading him to rebrand Twitter&amp;#8217;s corporate name to X Corp. after acquiring the platform last year. In line with his affinity for the letter, Musk plans to refer to tweets as &amp;#8220;Xs&amp;#8221; once the rebranding process is complete.Aside from his ventures with Tesla and SpaceX, Musk has also ventured into the realm of artificial intelligence with the recent establishment of xAI, a company aimed at competing with ChatGPT. Notably, he founded X.com in 1999, which later became PayPal, a successful online financial services company.Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has long held a fascination with the letter &amp;#8220;X,&amp;#8221; (Image: Shutterstock)Adding a personal touch, Musk chose the letter &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; as the name for one of his sons, whose mother is the singer Grimes. This unique name comprises a collection of letters and symbols, reflecting Musk&amp;#8217;s penchant for the extraordinary.What&amp;#8217;s Musk&amp;#8217;s Strategy?Musk&amp;#8217;s strategy for Twitter is to create an &amp;#8220;everything app,&amp;#8221; akin to China&amp;#8217;s WeChat, that offers a comprehensive platform integrating video chats, messaging, streaming, and payment services, as per Associated Press. This vision has driven Musk to implement drastic changes on Twitter, including a focus on paid subscriptions, in pursuit of his ambitious goal.While some of Musk&amp;#8217;s supporters may celebrate the rebranding, industry analysts express uncertainty about its prospects. The integration of Musk&amp;#8217;s personal brand with Twitter&amp;#8217;s corporate image has led to the loss of established brand equity among users and advertisers.As Musk implements changes to Twitter, including limiting daily tweet views and rolling out an $8-per-month subscription service, some users have grown dissatisfied with the platform. The success of the rebranding and the prospect of advertisers returning to Twitter will depend on the execution of Musk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;everything app&amp;#8221; vision.While Musk&amp;#8217;s choice to rename Twitter as &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; has garnered attention, some analysts question whether the new name might confuse the audience. The ongoing transformation of the platform remains a point of interest for both users and advertisers.As other tech giants like Alphabet (Google&amp;#8217;s parent company) and Facebook (renamed Meta in 2021) have undergone rebranding, Twitter&amp;#8217;s decision to move away from its recognizable blue bird logo signals a new direction for the platform.Associated Press contributed to this report","એલોન મસ્કે સોશિયલ મીડિયા પ્લેટફોર્મના મોટા રીબ્રાન્ડિંગ પ્રયાસના ભાગ રૂપે ટ્વિટર માટે નવા 'X' લોગોનું ખુલાસું કર્યું છે.

As Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo yatra enters its third leg in Karnataka, the first BJP-ruled state on the Kanyakumari-to-Kashmir journey, News18 walks along to decode what is fuelling the Congress leader and scores of others on the arduous march. In this series, we speak to Rahul Gandhi's fellow yatris and locals to gauge the mood, and analyse the political and electoral impact of the padyatra.PART 2 OF 5The third leg of Rahul Gandhi's 3,500-kilometre Bharat Jodo Yatra started in poll-bound Karnataka with two strong messages &amp;#8212; one for the Congress and the other for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In the well-attended gathering at Gundlupet, Gandhi said the Congress had a message for the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS): 'We will expose their corruption, rising unemployment and divisive politics of hate.' Gandhi had a message for the Congress as well. He held the hands of Congress's strong yet politically competitive leaders &amp;#8212; Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar &amp;#8212; while playing the drums, to send out a strong message of unity and the need to remain united. PART 1 | Amid Rajasthan Crisis, Can RaGa Salvage Congress with Bharat Jodo Karnataka Yatra?This is the second time that Gandhi is seen insisting that the two leaders show a united front as both leaders have been in the midst of an internal power struggle. Earlier, during Siddaramaiah's 75th birthday celebration, which was seen as a show of strength by the former CM and counter to the claims that he was sidelined in the party with the rise of Shivakumar, Gandhi asked both the leaders to give each other a hug.

He was given an Ishtalinga, a symbol of 'the universal force' which is tied to a thread across the chest as part of the deeksha or initiation.

gujarati_test_86,"A recent survey on Tuesday uncovered the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for various smartphone brands in India, in which Oppo took the top spot followed by OnePlus and Huawei. The top selling brands like Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo fell behind in the overall NPS score, according to the survey conducted by Numr Research, a market research company in India. The findings in this survey are based on the responses of over 500 respondents who were between 25 and 60 years of age at the time of the survey.

Net Promoter Score, popularly known as the NPS, is a metric for calculating customer satisfaction and loyalty. It is a proven marketeer's tool based on a single question - on a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend (a company or a service) to you friends, family or colleagues. A higher NPS score suggests that the customers are highly satisfied with the brand and will not shy away from suggesting their peers to buy the same product. While Oppo, OnePlus and Huawei take up the top three spots, popular brands like Apple (NPS of 68), Xiaomi (NPS of 66), Lenovo (NPS of 64) and Samsung (NPS of 63) follow them in a closely fought battle of marginal difference in scores.

According to the survey, Vivo, one of the top brand in terms of marketing spends and sales fell far behind with a score of only 25. &quot;This fiercely competitive market now has multiple products at every imaginable price point. In this environment, the NPS score helps in predicting who will win the war,&quot; said Amitayu Basu, CEO, Numr Research. &quot;With Oppo leading the way with 84 per cent NPS score, world leaders like Samsung and Apple are left to lick their wounds in their ever decreasing market share pie,&quot; Basu said.

In the survey, 52 per cent people reported that currently own only one smartphone where as 42 per cent reported that they have two. Another 5 per cent reported having three personal smartphones while one per cent claimed that they have four and more. More than 161 million smartphones were sold in India in 2018, said the survey. People also reported that they spend over an hour each on online shopping (64 min), social media (67 min) and watching movies/videos (69 min).","Numr Research દ્વારા એક તાજેતરના સર્વેમાં, Apple તેના નેટ પ્રમોટર સ્કોર (NPS) ના આધારે ભારતમાં ટોચના સ્માર્ટફોન બ્રાન્ડ તરીકે ઉભરી આવ્યું છે.

gujarati_test_89,"China's top diplomat Wang Yi visited Moscow on February 21, 2023, the first visit to Russia by a senior Chinese official since the invasion of Ukraine began nearly a year ago. Wang, who was named Chinese leader Xi Jinping's top foreign policy adviser last month, made the high-profile visit as the final stop in an eight-day international tour that included visits to France, Italy, and Hungary, as well as Germany for the Munich Security Conference. His trip came a day after US President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine.The timing was just days after US officials went public with concerns about how China's continuing partnership with Russia could have an impact on the war in Ukraine and hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced plans to suspend Russia's involvement in its last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the US.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while talking at CBS' 'Face the Nation' from Munich, said, 'The concern that we have now is based on information we have. They're considering providing lethal support, and we've made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship.' He also warned Wang 'about the implications and consequences' if China increases its support for Russia's war effort, during a meeting between the two on the sidelines of the conference.A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said that Wang's visit to Moscow would provide an opportunity for China and Russia to continue to develop their strategic partnership and 'exchange views' on 'international and regional hotspot issues of shared interest'. 'China is ready to take this visit as an opportunity and work with Russia to promote the steady growth of bilateral relations in the direction identified by the two heads of state, to defend the legitimate rights and interests of both sides, and play an active role for world peace.'During his meeting with Putin, he commented that China-Russia relations 'certainly can't be subject to pressure from any third countries', a clear dismissal of the idea that Beijing will allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) or the US to dictate its Russia policy.Wang also told Russia's Foreign Minister Lavrov, 'No matter how the international situation changes, China has been and remains committed, together with Russia, to make efforts to preserve the positive trend in the development of relations between major powers.'President Putin praised the 'new frontiers' reached by China-Russia relations and said both sides had 'agreed' that President Xi would soon travel to Moscow himself. The visit by Xi Jinping, which will likely take place next month, will be a defining moment and it is unlikely that Russia will launch any major offensive till the visit is over.Wang also reassured Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful secretary of the Russia Security Council that China is 'ready to join forces with the Russian side… to decisively stand up for national interests and virtues.'The ties between China and Russia underline the consistency of Beijing's approach towards Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is symptomatic of Beijing's unwavering partnership with Moscow or as China's leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin put it in February 2022, their 'friendship without limits' where no areas of cooperation were 'forbidden'.This is not a new development. China has demonstrated a willingness to strengthen ties with Russia throughout Xi's decade-long rule. Both countries share many ideas about the nature of the world. Most fundamentally, they believe that the Western-led international order and its underpinning rules and values constitute a threat to the current Chinese and Russian regimes.Both countries also accuse the US of unfairly using the dollar in the world's financial systems. 'Currencies should not be the trump card for unilateral sanctions, still less a disguise for bullying or coercion,' as per the Chinese Foreign Minister Qin. So, is the glue that holds Xi and Putin together a joint struggle against so-called Western hegemony? The vice-like grip of the ideological relationship endures.This provides fertile ground for cooperation in areas as varied as politics, economics, ideology, the military, and people-to-people relations. Though the relationship is asymmetrical, Beijing has the upper hand in economic terms as China accounts for 18 percent of total Russian trade whereas Russia accounts for only 2 percent of total Chinese trade. In the last 11 months, Sino-Russian trade totalled US $172.41 billion, up 32 percent year on year. The goal of both Moscow and Beijing is to hit an annual trade target of US $200 billion by 2024, the top item being crude which could decrease as China turns towards more renewable sources of energy.  But Russia can still provide support to China, for example in key aerospace technologies and nuclear weapons, not to mention an abundant supply of cheap energy sources.Despite the threat of secondary sanctions, trade between the two countries boomed last year. And recent data suggests that China has found ways to supply Russia with critical components such as microchips. It is, therefore, evident that both countries will continue to support each other's core interests.Amid the war in Ukraine, trade between the two countries is on the rise. Chinese and Russian diplomats maintain frequent contact. Bilateral military exercises continue unabated. While Chinese diplomats continue to express rhetorical support for territorial integrity in Ukraine, over the last year, China has not supported Russia at the United Nations but has chosen to abstain. It has refrained from providing Russia with weapons and has publicly proclaimed neutrality.China has also refused to condemn the invasion, often repeated the Russian perspective about the war, opposed sanctions against Russia and helped prop up its economy. But will relations between Moscow and Beijing grow more or less asymmetric in the years to come? The question that needs to be answered is that whether China would prefer a defeated, weak and destabilised Russia as its nuclear neighbour as the two countries share a 4,200 kilometres border.The prospect of a weakened regime in Russia will be viewed with uncomfortable uncertainty by China. Friendship and close ties with Russia provide China with secure borders and access to inland rail and road routes, and there is no doubt that China benefits from the US focus and engagement in Europe as it takes the pressure off the Indo-Pacific.As per Andrew Small, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund and the author of 'No Limits: The Inside Story Of China&amp;#8217;s War With The West', 'The relationship is still understood as a real asset and prize for Xi, even if there will be a weaker Russia emerging from this war.'  Conversely, Russia is also more dependent on China economically, militarily and politically.For Beijing, the worst-case scenario for the end of the war in Ukraine is Russia's defeat and subsequent regime change. The Chinese leadership will go to great lengths to prevent this from happening. But could this go beyond China's current rhetorical and economic engagement and translate into bolder attempts to strategically support Russia as the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested regarding China's consideration of supplying 'lethal support' to Russia.There is no doubt that the Chinese, who are finding themselves colliding with the US on a large range of issues, particularly after the outbreak of Covid and due to their aggression and assertiveness, need the friendship of Russia. President Xi in a recent statement said, 'Western countries led by the US are implementing all-round containment, encirclement and suppression against us.' Foreign Minister Qin said, 'Why talk big about respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Ukraine question but then not respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity in the question of China's Taiwan? In such an atmosphere, it is only to be expected that China sees President Putin as an essential partner.'While relations between the US and China continue to plummet, most recently due to the fallout from a suspected Chinese spy balloon that entered US airspace, China and Russia are as close as ever since their leaders declared a 'no-limits' friendship a year ago, partly driven by their shared animosity towards the US. But will this present escalation of Chinese support result in greater unpredictability in resolving the Ukrainian crisis?On February 28, President Lukashenko of Belarus arrived in Beijing for a three-day visit. Ned Price, the US State Department spokesman said, 'The fact that the PRC is now engaging with Lukashenko, who has, in effect, ceded his own sovereignty to Russia, is just another element of the PRC's deepening engagement with Russia, with all of those who are engaged with and supporting Russia's brutal war against Ukraine.'The war in Ukraine and the growing US-China rivalry will have a deep effect in the future. China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang talked of an invisible hand on March 7 and stated that 'the 'invisible hand' is 'using the Ukraine crisis to serve certain geopolitical agendas.' He further said, 'Conflict, sanctions, and pressure will not solve the problem&amp;#8230;The process of peace talks should begin as soon as possible, and the legitimate security concerns of all parties should be respected.'The West's hope for an international system based on democracy, rule of law, and multilateral cooperation seems to lack the traction it had. Current trends point toward a further ramping up of geopolitical competition. However, presently, since the protective shield is economic interdependencies, ties are likely to remain strong enough to prevent a complete lapse. In the meantime, the capacity for meeting global challenges, such as climate change, poverty, and global health threats, will suffer.Ukraine is no doubt the dominant story in the world. It is also evident that Chinese support for Russia is not going to wane. Further, it is unlikely that the US will soften and reset relations with China as President Biden has continued with Trump's policies. More increasingly, the similarities in the characters of the regime being authoritarian versus democratic is now being seen as an issue that cannot be ignored with the shift in public opinion. The geopolitical consequences of the new alignment between Russia and China are critical and will continue to be challenging to deal with, especially if we want to circumvent competition and confrontation.The author is an Army veteran.

'It is too early to conclude anything on Omicron at least before the end of December,&amp;#8221; he said.IGIB, an institute under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has been sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genes to detect Omicron and understand how it works.Explaining further, Agrawal said, 'We need to understand that the denominator is larger when it comes to India due to its size of population. Hence, the total number of severe cases will be large enough to break the entire healthcare system.'ALSO READ | Data Shows mRNA Vaccines the Best Boosters Against Covid, Modi Govt Must Get Them to India: Dr Gagandeep KangThe top scientist - who is also a pulmonologist and a medical researcher- explained why it&amp;#8217;s too early to conclude anything on the new variant of the novel coronavirus.'I would certainly want to wait for at least the end of December to conclude anything. Generally, the early part of the wave is mild and less severe. The reason is that young people get infected first because they are mobile. However, the wave intensifies as the infection reaches home and starts infecting elderly and vulnerable people,' he said.&amp;#8216;People not realising the importance of masks&amp;#8217; WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday flagged that 77 countries have so far reported cases of Omicron. He said that Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant and expressed concern that people are dismissing the strain as mild. &amp;#8220;Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,&amp;#8221; the WHO chief.Reacting to the comments, Agrawal said that the WHO has 'summarised it quite well'.'People are still not realising the emergence of Omicron. The public should immediately understand that only personal protection measures will help them in the long run. They must understand the importance of wearing masks and being compliant with Covid-appropriate behaviour,' he said.The bigger problem with the 'heavily mutated' variant is 'we still don&amp;#8217;t know which vaccine will work'.'We know, so far, the one who has had natural Covid-19 infection plus he is vaccinated may not be at high risk but the one who has never been infected but vaccinated could be at some sort of risk,' Agrawal said.&amp;#8216;Not much difference between South Africa and India&amp;#8217; Agrawal compared South Africa and India and concluded that it may not be correct to conclude that India is placed better.'We, like South Africa, are not a high-income country but a low and medium-income country. While we have a high seropositivity rate, we might witness re-infection cases here,' he said.We must consider that in South Africa the Covid-19 waves were caused by Beta and Delta strains, both, he added.ALSO READ | Omicron's Immune Escape Very High, Says CSIR&amp;#8217;s Top Scientist; Warns Against Rapid Rise in Cases But All Mild'Beta is likely to provide better protection and natural immunity against Omicron due to similar mutations whereas in India, infection was mostly caused by Delta,' Agrawal said. 'We can only hope what is true for them is true for us, but we need to prepare for the worst.'Commenting on the behaviour of Omicron in the United Kingdom, the scientist said, 'What&amp;#8217;s happening in the UK, Europe and South Africa shows us different pictures.

gujarati_test_91,"Gaming laptops are one of the most convenient and popular gaming devices for people out there. With as much portability and productivity as any other laptop (often even more), gaming laptops are beasts of machines when it comes to providing an immersive gaming experience, right up there with top-spec PCs and gaming consoles, if not better. Now, there are a lot of gaming laptops out there in the market, but if you really look at some of the top-end models like the Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 or the Acer Predator Helios or the latest Lenovo Legion 7, there is very less to tell them apart, given all of them are equipped with bleeding-edge specs and some fancy design bits. Since all these laptops come with bleeding-edge specifications, there is little difference in terms of capabilities, making the buyer's decision all the more difficult when it comes to purchasing one.Lenovo recently launched the Lenovo Legion 7 gaming laptop that makes this gaming laptops big-wigs battle tougher than it ever was. The laptop comes with all the makings of a mean gaming machine &amp;#8211; an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor with Radeon Graphics, paired with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB VRAM and 32GB of RAM &amp;#8211; all this with a 165Hz QHD+ display just reeks of performance. Now, I have been using the Lenovo Legion 7 as my primary laptop for both work and gaming and I will tell you how wide the use case for this machine goes. Hang on tight.The Lenovo Legion 7 design has been given much thought. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)DESIGNThe design on the Lenovo Legion 7 is striking. The laptop comes with all these sharp edges that give it quite an aggressive look. The body has an aluminium finish i a space grey kind of a colour that looks fresh if compared with those matte black gaming laptops, it's good Lenovo is going different with its gaming laptop designs. The Legion logo on the laptop&amp;#8217;s back panel lights up. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)There is a plain back panel with just small Lenovo and Legion brandings. The Legion logo placed on the top left corner of the screen is nice and subtle, and the three-pointed star within the 'O' of Legion lights up in this blue light which looks pretty cool. The display also has minimal bezels and looks pretty neat with the camera cutout lifted a little. There is a neon lights strip running through three sides of the bottom of the Lenovo Legion 7. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)I especially like the hinge on this laptop. It is basically a metal bar that sits a little ahead of the lower part of the laptop, so as to let the screen lay flat. The hinge also has the Legion logo on both ends &amp;#8211; good attention to detail. The speakers are placed above the RGB keyboard, which has many variations and brightness levels for gamers to play with. There is also an LED light that runs through the button borders of the laptop and it looks damn cool, especially when the Lenovo Legion 7 is sitting on a desk in low light.The hinge on the Lenovo Legion 7 Pro is pretty neat. It has the Legion logo on either sides and helps the laptop lay flat. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)Two of my favourite things about this design, however, are that all the ports are placed on the backside of the laptop, so wires will never get in your way during those intense gaming sessions and the icons of each port are backlit on the panel to avoid confusion. Very thoughtful. Second bit I loved the most is the placement of the air vents &amp;#8211; none are placed below the laptop and that really helps with keeping the heating in check. All the air outlets are placed on the sides or the back, below the ports on the laptop and with this, the Lenovo Legion 7 manages the thermals better than any of its competitors. Great design &amp;#8211; thoughtful and detailed, while making the laptop look as good as it can. The lights, however, may be too much for some users (not for me). Ports on the back side of the Lenovo Legion 7 is a pretty neat design bit. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)DISPLAYThe Lenovo Legion 7 comes with a 16-inch QHD+ display with 100 percent sRGB coverage and 165Hz refresh rate. It also comes with up to 500 nits of peak brightness which is just enough to enjoy all kinds of content in every scenario. Even under the sun this display performed pretty well and never made me feel the lack of brightness or backlight. The Lenovo Legion 7 comes with a QHD+ display with 165Hz refresh rate. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)The 165Hz refresh rate of course makes all the difference in the world. While it does enable up to 120FPS gaming, it also makes mundane tasks like scrolling feel much more immersive and smooth. This display is made for gaming and it shows. Watching movies and TV shows is as pleasing as it can be on any laptop screen.During my time with the Lenovo Legion 7, I mostly played Forza Horizon 5, and that game maxed out at a 165FPS frame rate, which was just a beautiful experience all throughout. The resolution also makes the screen usage optimal and this screen really puts things in perspective, in terms of how much screen resolution matters. I went from using an HP ProBook for work to the Lenovo Legion 7, and the amount of text or windows this resolution can fit is much more than what you can do with an FHD+ display. The 165Hz display enables 120FPS gaming. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)The colour accuracy and sharpness is also on-point and I didn't struggle one bit while editing photos and matching colours. In fact, this display made me go back to some of my older edited photos, only for me to find out that the colour matching was off in most of them &amp;#8211; all of this because of the much improved colour accuracy on this laptop. PERFORMANCE AND BATTERYNow, coming to the thing this is made for &amp;#8211; performance. As we have mentioned above, the Lenovo Legion 7 is packed with bleeding edge specifications &amp;#8211; an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX processor with AMD Radeon graphics, paired with a 16GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and 32GB of RAM with a 165Hz QHD+ display seems like an overkill. Only that it&amp;#8217;s not. All these specifications do is give the user confidence that whatever task they throw at this machine, it won't even flinch while taking them on.Lenovo Legion 7&amp;#8217;s bleeding edge specs never make it feel out of power. The thermal management is also superb. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)I used this laptop for my regular gaming and it gave great results. As mentioned above, this laptop enables up to 120FPS gaming which gives you a solid edge over competition if you are in an online match. On Forza Horizon 5, the maximum supported frame rate went all the way up to 165FPS. This is the first gaming laptop I have tested in recent times that goes that high up in the latest Forza game so that is just amazing. It does everything smoothly, and thanks to the bleeding edge specs that may never make the laptop feel low on power. Forza Horizon 5 ran on maxed-out 165FPS on the Lenovo Legion 7. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)Now, one thing I don't like about gaming laptops is that they can't run at their max capacity if not plugged into the charger, and this one is no different. But here, the bigger issue is that the charger with the Lenovo Legion 7 has a 300W adapter and that is the kind of power not all inverters or power backups can handle. Even if so, it will use a lot of power while doing it. Not exactly what most people want. The lighting on the laptop may be too much for some users. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)The battery on the laptop is also better than most gaming laptops out there. While it is not in a thin and light or M1 MacBook category, it still lasts about 3-4 hours on power, which is good enough for a laptop this size running a power guzzling GPU and the heavy lighting. The 300W charger, however, charges the Lenovo Legion 7 pretty quickly. I did not get to test the charging speeds on an exact timer, but it is super fast in terms of a laptop. One thing that impressed me quite a bit on the Lenovo Legion 7 is the sound system. The laptop is great for watching content or even playing games without headphones. The speaker system powered by Harman is pretty great with the 3D surround sound which Lenovo is calling 3D Nahimic Audio. It is super loud and you can feel the bass, highs and lows on a laptop speaker. This would be one of the best speaker systems on a laptop out there without a doubt. Neat.The battery on the Lenovo Legion 7 is also better than most gaming laptops out there. (Image Credit: News18/ Darab Mansoor Ali)VERDICTSo that was the Lenovo Legion 7 gaming laptop. It comes with all the specifications and features that gamers need from a machine they don't wish to change in at least the next couple of years. It is, however, the attention to detail that makes the Lenovo Legion 7 stand out from the competition, and that is something to be appreciated here. Not every gaming laptop-maker thinks about the aesthetics or sound quality the way Lenovo Legion 7 takes care of it, and just because of that, it can easily be called one of the most attractive laptops out there. There are however a couple of caveats. One, the laptop is heavy and has a 16-inch screen, putting it in the 'big' laptop category. Add to that the massive 300W charging adapter, and it is not the most portable laptop, might just be the least portable for that matter. Second, as with most gaming laptops, it is expensive. While it does justify every penny of that cost, it still costs more than Rs 2,30,000, which is big money to be shelled out for a laptop.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.","લેનોવોએ તેનું લીજન 7 ગેમિંગ લૉપટોપ લોન્ચ કર્યું છે, જે ઉચ્ચ-અંતની વિશિષ્ટતાઓથી સજ્જ છે, જેમાં AMD રાયઝેન 9 5900HX પ્રોસેસર, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 GPU અને 165Hz QHD+ ડિસ્પ્લે શામેલ છે. લaptopsપટોપમાં તીખા ધારાઓ અને એલ્યુમિનિયમ ફિનિશ સાથે આકર્ષક ડિઝાઈન છે. પાછળના પેનલ પર લીજન લોગો પ્રકાશિત થાય છે, અને નીચેની બાજુએ નીઓન લાઇટ સ્ટ્રીપ ચાલે છે. લaptopsપટોપમાં 165Hz રિફ્રેશ દર અને 100% sRGB કવરેજ સાથે 16-ઇંચ QHD+ ડિસ્પ્લે છે. તે ઉત્તમ પ્રદર્શન પ્રદાન કરે છે, જેમાં 120FPS સુધી ગેમિંગ છે, અને તેની બેટરી લાઈફ 3-4 કલાક છે. જો કે, તે ભારે અને મોંઘું છે, અને તેની કિંમત રૂ. 2,40,000 થી વધુ છે."
gujarati_test_92,"The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED laptop recently debuted in India, and it comes with a 360-degree &amp;#8220;ergo-lift&amp;#8221; design. It essentially means that the keyboard gets slightly tilted in the clamshell form for a better typing experience, but users can also use the notebook as a tablet, thanks to the screen&amp;#8217;s 360-degree rotation capability. However, the selling point is the OLED display that Asus ZenBooks and VivoBooks are adopting aggressively. The company recently launched the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED, which received a mixed reception in our review. Asus Zenbooks, on the other hand, are Asus&amp;#8217; premium line of productivity-focused laptops, but can the new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED deliver what it promises? Here&amp;#8217;s our breakdown.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED Price in IndiaCustomers can choose between three storage variants, and the RAM configuration remains standard across the new ZenBook Flip models. The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED&amp;#8217;s price in India starts at Rs 91,990 for the variant with AMD Ryzen 5 5600H CPU + 16GB RAM + 512GB SSD. The middle variant with Ryzen 7 5800H CPU + 16GB RAM + 1TB SSD costs Rs 1,12,990 and the top model with Ryzen 9 5900HX carries a price tag of 1,34,990. We received a review unit with Ryzen 7 5800H processor paired with AMD Radeon GPU. The laptop features a metallic black finish, which is pretty standard across Asus notebooks.The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED comes in black metallic finish. The Asus Pen stylus is sold separately. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)At this price range, one can even consider purchasing Apple&amp;#8217;s M1-powered MacBooks and it&amp;#8217;s not an easy road for Asus with Zenbook 14 Flip OLED.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED Design and DisplayThe new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED comes with an &amp;#8220;ergo-lift&amp;#8221; design that tilts the keyboard mildly to offer a comfortable typing experience. We also get a centrally-aligned trackpad, which I usually like, as it offers more space to rest your palms. The hinge mechanism is solid, and users can smoothly use the notebook in &amp;#8216;tent-mode&amp;#8217; to watch video content or as a tablet for reading and even gaming.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED features 360-degree &amp;#8220;ergo-lift&amp;#8221; design. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)In terms of build, the laptop gets an aluminium alloy lid and chassis that is as sturdy as it sounds. To top it up, the device gets US MIL-STD-810 standard to ensure tough durability. Sadly, the lid does not get an anti-fingerprint coating, and it will leave fingerprint smudges. Our packaging included a sleek laptop sleeve to protect from dust. It also ensures easy portability, but the sleeve cannot fit the charging adapter.The chiclet keyboard on the laptop provides decent feedback that won&amp;#8217;t disappoint customers who spend long hours typing. The power button doubles as a fingerprint scanner for security that was responsive during our review period. There&amp;#8217;s no physical shutter for the 720p webcam, but users can use the dedicated hotkey to control its visibility.The trackpad on the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED has a smooth finish with a good amount of travel. A dedicated switch will convert the trackpad into a numb-pad &amp;#8211; a good addition for those who spend hours on spreadsheets.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is powered by AMD CPUs. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)But the highlight of the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is its 14-inch touch-enabled OLED screen with 2.8K (2880 x 1800 pixels) resolution that offers a rich viewing experience. Be it gaming, editing, reading, or watching content &amp;#8211; there&amp;#8217;s nothing to complain about Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED&amp;#8217;s display performance. Users can also increase the refresh rate up to 90Hz from the advanced display settings. Although it is not as smooth as the 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate screens, you won&amp;#8217;t be dissatisfied with the viewing/scrolling experience.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED (L) vs Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 (5410)&amp;#8217;s Full-HD display. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)If I have to nitpick, I&amp;#8217;d suggest that the screen with anti-fingerprint coating would have sufficed. To be fair, many touch-enabled laptop screens do not come with this coating, and a handy solution could be Amazon Basic&amp;#8217;s Microfiber Cleaning Cloth (pack of six), which costs just Rs 299.Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED PerformanceThe last Asus notebook-cum-tablet that we reviewed &amp;#8211; the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED, did not offer reliable performance due to a sub-standard processor and lack of heat-dissipating vents. The new Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED, on the other hand, delivers highly reliable performance and the dual-fan​ cooling system works efficiently. I mostly used the laptop for work (regular web browsing, watching content) and light photo editing, and the fan noise was hardly audible. Switching between web tabs and multiple folders was smooth &amp;#8211; thanks to the AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, 16GB of RAM, LPDDR4X RAM, and NVMe PCIe 3.0 SSD storage.Using the laptop in different viewing modes was also smooth, and my favourite is the tent mode to watch movies. As expected, the movie-viewing experience was immersive, and the fan noise again remained barely audible. The speakers of Harman Kardon deliver clear audio with hardly any bass.Asus Asus ZenBook 14 Flip OLED comes with a 14-inch touch-enabled screen. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)In terms of benchmarks, the Asus Asus ZenBook 14 Flip OLED attained 5,249 points which is not bad at all. In the 3D Mark&amp;#8217;s Sky Driver test for DirectX 11 graphics hardware, the two-in-one laptop scored 13,069 points. We couldn&amp;#8217;t test demanding games due to the short-term availability of the laptop, but it was able to run Asphalt 9 smoothly.The keyboard has multiple backlit modes, and the laptop gets stylus support. Asus sent us the Asus Pen Stylus (sold separately), which features a smooth-cylindrical design but it is not as versatile as the Asus Pen 2.0 that I enjoyed using on the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED. Because of the wide grip and smooth finish, the stylus will be sufficient for regular scribbling but don&amp;#8217;t expect too much creativity out of it.Connectivity options are also standard &amp;#8211; we get two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports (support display/power delivery), a single HDMI 2.0b port, a Micro SD card reader, a 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack, and a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port. On the wireless side, there&amp;#8217;s Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0, which is more than enough for most users. Lastly, there&amp;#8217;s also a 720p webcam that is average at best.The Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED includes a 100W fast charger. (Image: Abhik Sengupta / News18)Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED BatteryThe Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED carries a 63Whr battery that takes roughly 1.5 hours to charge with the bundled 100w adapter. I was getting roughly six to seven hours of battery backup during regular work cycles with 90Hz refresh rate enabled. This could expand if you use the laptop to watch content or reading with light web browsing and standard refresh (60Hz) enabled.Sony WF-C500 Review: Mid-Budget TWS Earbuds That Won&amp;#8217;t DisappointAsus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED VerdictThe Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED is a solid 2-in-1 notebook that offers a great display performance. Paired with decent battery backup, touch support, rotating screen, and noiseless fans (in most use cases) &amp;#8211; the laptop is easily worth recommending.As always, the pertinent question remains who should go for this costly notebook. For regular customers planning to buy an affordable 2-in-1 notebook with a reliable display, the Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 (5410) at roughly Rs 62,000, is a good option to consider. For upcoming creators wanting a more colour accurate display &amp;#8211; the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED will not disappoint. For enterprise users, the laptop can fulfil most demands, but a 14-inch display for spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel is quite average.Read all the Latest Tech News and Breaking News here","આસુસ ઝેનબુક 14 ફ્લિપ OLED લેપટોપ ભારતમાં લોન્ચ કરવામાં આવ્યો છે, જેમાં 360-ડિગ્રી 'એરગો-લિફ્ટ' ડિઝાઇન અને OLED ડિસ્પ્લે છે. લેપટોપ ત્રણ સ્ટોરેજ વેરિઅન્ટમાં આવે છે, જેની કિંમતો Rs 91,990થી Rs 1,34,990 સુધી છે. તેમાં મજબૂત એલ્યુમિનિયમ એલોય બિલ્ડ અને આરામદાયક ચિકલેટ કીબોર્ડ છે. તેનો મુખ્ય આકર્ષણ તેનો 14-ઇંચનો ટચ-સક્ષમ OLED સ્ક્રીન છે, જેમાં 2.8K રિઝોલ્યુશન છે, જે સમૃદ્ધ દર્શન અનુભવ આપે છે. લેપટોપ તેના AMD Ryzen પ્રોસેસર અને ડ્યુઅલ-ફેન કૂલિંગ સિસ્ટમ સાથે વિશ્વસનીય પ્રદર્શન આપે છે. તેમાં લગભગ છ થી સાત કલાકની બેટરી બેકઅપ પણ છે. કુલ મળીને, તે એક મહાન ડિસ્પ્લે સાથે એક મજબૂત 2-ઇન-1 નોટબુક છે."
gujarati_test_93,"The Islamist voice in the US Congress, Ilhan Omar, came out with a press release and introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit last week. The press release says: 'Ilhan Omar introduced a resolution today to condemn human rights violations and violations of international religious freedom in India, including those targeting Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, Dalits, Adivasis, and other religious and cultural minorities.'Her inclusion of just one word, 'Jews', is the biggest advertisement of how Western media and a section of Dem-Labour establishment have leaned entirely on their biases to talk about India and how little they care to know or research about the country they so despise. It also exposes Omar&amp;#8217;s hypocrisy about pretending to care about Jews after years of anti-Semitic utterances and siding with Islamic aggression and terror against Israel.India's 7,000-odd Jews face no discrimination. Israel has repeatedly acknowledged that Jews have been treated unjustly in almost every part of the world except India. A 2009 worldwide study commissioned by the Israeli foreign ministry showed that the greatest level of sympathy towards Israel was in India, with 58% of Indian respondents being quite positive about Israel. In February 2007, during the first Jewish-Hindu interfaith leadership summit in New Delhi, Rabbi Yona Metzger said, 'Jews have lived in India for over 2,000 years and have never been discriminated against. This is something unparalleled in human history.'Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu reinforced during his 2018 India visit that 'Jews in India have never witnessed antisemitism like in some other countries. This is a tribute to India&amp;#8217;s great civilisation, tolerance and democracy.'Ilhan and her ilk, who have no real experience of this nation but use lazy toolkits and templates to further their anti-India agenda, are trying to fire from the shoulders of their other target, the Jews, to tarnish the great Bharatiya civilisation, its tolerance and democracy.Whether it is Barack Obama, under whose presidency the US dropped more than 26,000 bombs on seven Muslim countries in just 2016, or Sabrina Siddique, a Muslim Wall Street Journal journalist whose question to PM Modi had nothing to do with economy or business but about…you guessed it…Muslims, it was as if the anti-India lobby was firing from all its weaponry without even understanding the shape and nature of its target.Obama talked about India's ethnic Muslim population, little realising that Indian Muslims are of the same ethnicity as Hindus. They simply got converted, mostly by the sword during Islamic invasions and rule.Those saying Muslims are persecuted and not allowed to practice their religion in India — Obama even hinted at the possibility of civil war and balkanisation — just need to walk the nation's streets, especially on Fridays, to know better. Even then if they choose to shut their eyes, there is data and more data.  A 2021 Pew research with a staggering 30,000 respondents found that 98% Muslims in India said they were free to practice their religion. Just 2% said they were not 'too free'.Under Modi, the share of Muslims in prison population (convicts, undertrials, detenues) declined to 18.7% in 2021 from 20.2% in 2020.Muslims have been equal beneficiaries of welfare from housing to cooking gas, water to electricity, health cover to vaccines.The narrative of persecution only exists in the agenda of anti-India interests who seem to have converged — Wahabi and Salafi Islamists, evangelical missionaries, globalist Commies, and sections of Western deep states. Their homework and respect for facts are weak, but they make it up with bountiful will to hurt India.Abhijit Majumder is a senior journalist.

gujarati_test_96,"Horses have hardly raised political heat in a state where they are so rare, except in sculptures of ancient temples. As the Odisha government plans to relocate a modern statue of a horse from a major roundabout in the capital Bhubaneswar to facilitate beautification of the site, there is massive hue and cry. The Opposition parties have protested any relocation of the statue and the people of Bhubaneswar seem divided.The sudden outpouring of emotions for this 33-year-old statue of a horse and warrior from Mastercanteen Square in Bhubaneswar started when the state government's Department of Culture granted last week the Bhubaneswar Smart City Limited's (BSCL) wish to shift it. As per plans, the huge stone statue would be shifted to Raj Bhawan Square so that BSCL could begin widening of the roads around Mastercanteen Square and build modern public amenities there.News of the shifting plans led to protests by the Opposition - both the BJP and the Congress - as it has accused Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government of disrespecting the state's art and culture. Senior Congress MLA and former minister Suresh Chandra Routray sat in protest near the statue and vowed never to allow it to be relocated until he is alive. Soon eminent writers, sculptors, artistes and other public figures voiced their protest to the shifting plans, saying it would mean a 'damage to Odisha's heritage'.The horse statue at the centre of controversy is a replica of the iconic horse and warrior sculptures seen in the 13th-century Sun Temple of Konark, some 60 km off Bhubaneswar. The Odisha government had adopted the Konark horse and warrior as the state's emblem in 1964. The statue seen at Mastercanteen Square was built by famous Odisha sculptor Raghunath Panigrahi, a Padma Bibhushan awardee who passed away last month after battling with COVID-19.It was Odisha's Congress Chief Minister JB Patnaik, who had put this statue at the public square in 1988. Since then, standing as it does on a stone pedestal in front of Bhubaneswar railway station, this statue has become a popular monument and has been identified with the city of Bhubaneswar.'There is a plan to widen the roads at Mastercanteen Square and build a multi-modal hub there along with a flyover. Once they are built, visibility of this horse statue will be greatly reduced. It may become invisible. That is why we have allowed its shifting to another square, so that it remains preserved,' said Ranjan Das, Director of the Department of Culture.But those protesting the relocation plans want the statue to be where it is. 'This statue is synonymous with the city of Bhubaneswar. Why cannot the government build the flyover and other infrastructure while letting this statue stay where it is? Modernisation plans must not be allowed to damage heritage structures in any way,' said Prafulla Rath, an eminent researcher on Jagannath culture.'Many eminent people of Odisha have been hurt by plans to relocate this monument. This monument symbolises our heritage. So the Odisha government should respect the sentiments of the people and consider beautifying the Mastercanteen Square without relocating the statue,' said Union petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan of BJP.Horses have been as rare in Odisha's landscape as horse trading in the state's politics. Growing public sentiment against relocation plans of the horse statue has put the state government in a dilemma. Even as political protests are gathering force, the last word on it is yet to come.Read all the Latest News, Breaking News and Coronavirus News here.","ઓડિશા સરકારની ભુવનેશ્વરના મુખ્ય રાઉન્ડઅબાઉટમાંથી ઘોડાની પ્રતિમાને સ્થળાંતર કરવાની યોજનાએ વિવાદ અને વિરોધને જન્મ આપ્યો છે. આ પ્રતિમા, જે કોનાર્કના સૂર્યમંદિરની પ્રતિમાઓની નકલ છે, ૩૦ વર્ષથી વધુ જૂની છે અને શહેરમાં લોકપ્રિય સ્મારક બની ગઈ છે. વિપક્ષીય પક્ષો અને જાહેર આકૃતિઓએ સરકાર પર રાજ્યની કળા અને સંસ્કૃતિનો અપમાન કરવાનો આક્ષેપ કર્યો છે, જ્યારે સરકારનો દાવો છે કે રસ્તા પહોળા અને આધુનિકીકરણ માટે સ્થળાંતર જરૂરી છે. આ મુદ્દાએ ભુવનેશ્વરના લોકોને વિભાજિત કર્યા છે અને સરકારને પ્રતિમાના ભવિષ્ય વિશેની દુવિધામાં મૂકી છે."

'So far our information goes, eight-nine deaths, caused by the disease have been reported but the government is concealing that figure,' he said.Several cases of dengue have been reported in Kolkata, and two of them have died, according to officials.Reacting to Majumdar's accusations, Hakim claimed that the BJP leader is busy doing politics over the disease.'The BJP is not concerned about people. It only believes in stunts and media publicity. We are aware of the dengue situation and taking whatever steps are required,' said Hakim, also the municipal affairs and urban development minister.He asserted that dengue cases are reported during the monsoon every year and the situation is under control.Meanwhile, taking a jibe at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her recent claim that dengue is spreading in the state from neighbouring Bangladesh, Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari wondered why doesn't she send a TMC delegation to Dhaka to discuss the issue with 'her friend' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.Adhikari said, 'The CM had made such an absurd comment to hide her failure to check the menace.'

gujarati_test_100,"Our idea of family drama, love affairs, and entertainment has been widely influenced by Bollywood films. And when it comes to portraying these elements in a middle-class household, Maddock Films have delivered some of the most entertaining stories in the genre. Their films have a comforting level of earthiness, riding high on emotions with detailed characters and nuances which strike chords. However, what does one do, when the emotions hit home but the plot doesn't and looks repetitive to not hold us long enough?The previous films from the same production house, be it Luka Chuppi, Hindi Medium, Mimi were well received by the audience. However, a recurring theme in these stories was the creation of a fake scenario within the plot, only to be revealed later on.Similarly, Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali Khan's Zara Hatke Zara Bachke rides high on family values and emotions. However, an over-exaggeration of their relationship nuances lacks novelty. They portray a happily married couple, celebrating little things, and stealing moments for keeping their spark alive. However, as they live in a joint family, their otherwise perfect marriage lacks one thing &amp;#8211; the need for privacy. Hence, in order to have that, the couple fakes a divorce, battles all odds, and fakes a hundred fights only to have a flat for themselves, through a very valid government scheme.  View this post on InstagramA post shared by Vicky Kaushal (@vickykaushal09)The first half of the movie keeps one hooked but is slow-paced in defining the intentions of these characters. Director Laxman Utekar has done a fantastic job of getting the detailing right. Be it Vicky's thoughtful gestures for Sara, despite being a miser, the elements relate well with every middle-class household. While a few comedy scenes could have been discarded, the first half remains entertaining. However, it's the second half, when one starts dreading the run time. The second half will also remind you of Luka Chuppi. While there are a lot of tears, drama, fights and family bonding moments, the predictable plot, despite a strong screenplay, doesn't hold us long enough. The film fails to provoke much-needed emotions, despite commendable acting by the lead stars. Vicky Kaushal's acting feels completely natural. He steps into the shoes of his character, Kapil, effortlessly. There's so much conviction in his performance. He fights, romances, and falls apart with so much honesty that you'd empathise with him. He brings in the right sense of charm, sense and sensitivity with his on-screen persona. Sara Ali Khan looks too polished trying to keep up but falls short with her performance. Her dialogues are well written, however, there's a lack of focus on how she delivers them. She looks comfortable as Saumya but doesn't stick by her. Nevertheless, there's an honest effort from her end in living up to the traits of a small-town girl. The on-screen chemistry between Vicky and Sara is palpable, and they infuse every frame with warmth. They balance each other well. Their banter is laced with perfect comic timing. Their fights look too real and intense. The comforting music and songs are another strong element in the film which beautifully captures the small-town charm, its people, and the kind of conversations and societal norms, people submit to.All in all, Zara Hatke Zara Bachke is a clean entertainer and doesn't come off as too preachy. It has family-friendly written all over it and has all the elements of a typical commercial Bollywood entertainer.","ઝરા હટકે ઝરા બચકે, જે મેડોક ફિલ્મ્સ દ્વારા નિર્મિત છે, તે દંપતીની હૃદયસ્પર્શી વાર્તા રજૂ કરવાનો પ્રયાસ કરે છે જે તેમના સંયુક્ત પરિવારમાં ગોપનીયતા મેળવવા માટે તલાકનું નાટક કરે છે. ફિલ્મનો પ્રથમ ભાગ મધ્યમ વર્ગના તત્વોથી ભરેલો આનંદદાયક છે, પરંતુ બીજી અર્ધમાં અનુમાનિત કથાકાર અને ભાવનાત્મક ઊંડાણની કમીને કારણે તે દર્શકો પર તેની પકડ ગુમાવી દે છે. વિક્કી કૌશલ એક મજબૂત પ્રદર્શન આપે છે, જ્યારે સારા અલી ખાન તેમના અભિનયમાં ઓછું પડે છે. મુખ્ય કલાકારો વચ્ચેની સ્ક્રીન પરની રાસાયણિક અને આરામદાયક સંગીત ફિલ્મની આકર્ષણમાં વધારો કરે છે, જે તેને એક સામાન્ય વેપારી બોલીવૂડ મનોરંજન બનાવે છે."

gujarati_test_102,"When Imran Khan took over as the Prime Minister in 2018, it was a special day for Pakistan&amp;#8217;s democracy. It was the first democratic transition in the country's history, which had oscillated between military rule and short stints of representative governance.Imran Khan took over the reins from the government led by the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party, which ruled the country for a full term. Nawaz Sharif was the Prime Minister for the majority of the five years and later his brother Shehbaz Sharif completed the five-year tenure.With Khan's rise to power, there was a buzz that the popular leader could complete a full five-year term. In its 70-year history, Pakistan has seen the rule of more than 20 prime ministers. However, none could complete a full term.The longest stint in power has been that of the country&amp;#8217;s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, whose term lasted 4 years and 2 months. And it seems he may continue to hold the record, given the no-trust motion to oust Imran Khan.Democratic upsurgesIt could be said that there have been several upsurges of democracy in Pakistan as the country witnessed events of superficial democratic stints that did not last long.After Liaqat Ali Khan, the country saw several prime ministers, but no one could complete five years in office. The concentration of power remained in the hands of the military and democracy couldn't bloom.The only times the country could see a constitutional government was during Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and later Nawaz Sharif.Bhutto, the founder of the Pakistan Peoples Party, came to power on August 14, 1973, adopted a new constitution, and carried out a series of reforms. However, democracy was short-lived when General Zia-ul-Haq imposed martial law and Bhutto was hanged in 1979. He was the fourth-longest serving prime minister whose rule lasted over four years.On the other hand, Nawaz Sharif served as the prime minister for three non-consecutive terms. He first became the PM in 1990, was ousted in 1993, returned to power in 1997, but a military takeover ended that stint in 1999. He occupied the post once more in 2013 but was removed by the country&amp;#8217;s Supreme Court in 2017 over corruption charges.After Sharif, when Imran Khan came to power, it was being seen as a consolidation of democracy in the country, which has had weak democratic roots. The no-confidence motion and likely collapse of the Imran Khan government show the fragility of Pakistan&amp;#8217;s democracy. Islamabad is heading towards the same road of military dictatorship with intervals of democratic rule.Khan's fate has not been very different from his predecessors. His popularity, rise to power, and the subsequent decline has been very similar to those of someone like Benazir Bhutto.Follow thy neighbourEvents in Pakistan cannot be seen in isolation. Its history and politics often sync with those of its neighbours.In the late 1980s, Aung San Suu Kyi started demonstrations for democracy in Myanmar; it resonated in Pakistan. Around the same period, in 1988, Benazir Bhutto came to power after Zia-ul-Haq&amp;#8217;s military government.Despite being one of the most popular leaders, she could not remain on the post for long and ruled for two short spells.Imran Khan's fate can be likened to Bhutto&amp;#8217;s, who despite emerging as a popular leader couldn't sustain the hold on power.With Khan losing the majority, it may not end well for the country, as history shows that if a civilian leader has been abruptly removed, the chances of a military swoop to restore order are high. It is also a well-known fact that the military enjoys deep clout behind the scenes and control over institutions.The falloutImran's decline is not just news for Pakistan, but it shows the effects of and has ramifications for the politics in the subcontinent and the world.Ukraine is in chaos after the Russian invasion. Sri Lanka is seeing an unprecedented economic crisis. Pakistan's bête noire Afghanistan just witnessed the formation of an authoritarian Taliban government.Such events in a democracy are broadly contagious and often have a domino effect.Read the Latest News and Breaking News here","પાકિસ્તાનના પ્રધાનમંત્રી ઇમરાન ખાનને અવિશ્વાસ પ્રસ્તાવનો સામનો કરવો પડી રહ્યો છે, જે દેશના લોકતંત્રની નાજુકતા વિશે ચિંતાઓ ઊભી કરી રહ્યો છે. પાકિસ્તાનનો ઇતિહાસ ટૂંકા ગાળાના લોકતંત્ર સાથે જોડાયેલો છે, જેમાં કોઈ પણ પ્રધાનમંત્રી પોતાનો સંપૂર્ણ કાર્યકાળ પૂર્ણ કરી શક્યો નથી. ખાને સત્તામાં આવવું લોકતંત્રના મજબૂતિકરણ તરીકે જોવામાં આવ્યું હતું, પરંતુ તેમની ઘટતી લોકપ્રિયતા અગાઉના નેતાઓ જેમ કે બેનઝીર ભુટ્ટોની સમાન છે. જો ખાનને અચાનક પદ પરથી દૂર કરી દેવામાં આવશે, તો ક્રમ પુનઃસ્થાપિત કરવા માટે સૈન્ય હસ્તક્ષેપની ઊંચી શક્યતા છે, જેમ કે ઇતિહાસે દર્શાવ્યું છે. પાકિસ્તાનની રાજકીય સ્થિતિનો ઉપખંડ અને વિશ્વ પર પ્રભાવ પડે છે, કારણ કે રાજકીય અસ્થીરતાનો ડોમિનો અસર થઈ શકે છે."

gujarati_test_104,"US defence secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in India on March 19, early in the Joe Biden presidency, to take forward the US-India defence and security relations given a fillip by this month&amp;#8217;s summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, dubbed the Quad. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, reminded him to also take up their concerns about human rights abuses and declining democratic norms in India. The other issue of equal concern to the United States is the continuing defence cooperation between India and Russia.The Indian side denied that India's human rights record was discussed, dissimulating that in fact the issue only came up in the context of concerns of minorities in Afghanistan in a post US troop withdrawal scenario. Secretary Austin in his media interaction insisted that 'conversations' did occur on US concerns about India's worsening record at home. But clearly it was not a stumbling block to bilateral relations: the US is using it more to satisfy congressional concerns and employ it as a lever to press New Delhi on the other issue, i.e., Russian defence sales to India.The US desire to rope-in India is driven by its China balancing strategy. In that sense, the Biden administration is merely continuing, albeit more smartly, Donald Trump's China policy, involving rallying of select democracies of the Indo-Pacific by the revival of the four-nation Quad, consisting of Australia, India, Japan and the US, in 2017. The grouping was born a decade earlier in 2007, when President George W Bush was in office. Meanwhile, US-Russia relations have incrementally worsened since Russia's intervention in Ukraine in 2014. Democrats felt that Russia had played a role via social media and direct interference to tilt the 2016 US presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. Although Trump maintained a tough stance on Russia, he never directly blamed Russian president Vladimir Putin or named him as a mastermind in various suspected cyber-attacks on US corporate and national security agencies. President Biden assumed office convinced of Russian interference in US electoral affairs.In 2017, the US Congress had passed the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). Then defence secretary Jim Mattis failed to get mitigating clauses added to enable the US administration to allow exemptions. So, as the law stands, it is difficult to apply it selectively, particularly as US-Russian relations have only worsened after President Biden took charge, especially his agreeing with a questioner that Russian president Putin is a 'killer'. The US is also seeing growing convergence between Russia and China, complicating US containment of what is seen as errant behaviour of both. Some analysts opine that US-Russian relations may be the worst they have been since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Former defence secretary Robert Gates feels that sanctions against Russia 'are not going to do much good', as it now has China to trade with.What is being thus called the new Cold War has China at its centre, with Russia as a supporting actor in countering the US. But the motivations of the two differ. While Putin is the great disruptor, China wants to compete and dominate the next generation of technologies in telecommunications and artificial intelligence, besides controlling rule-making of existing and new regimes at a multilateral level. From the US perspective, the 2+2 meeting at Alaska between the foreign ministers and NSAs of the United States and China was to convey US readiness to take up the Chinese challenge in technological competition.Into this new maze India is thrust, having its own differentiated strategic motivation. India-Russia relations may not be as warm as they were during the Cold War, but New Delhi realises that Russia is important for India to maintain a balanced foreign policy. India would not like Russia to move fully into the China-Pakistan corner for various reasons. One is its ability to produce and sell weapons that give value for money and often involve technology transfer. Also India cannot switch from its hybrid defence equipment mix to US dominated supplies overnight. Russia is also an important player in West Asia and Iran. It has carved out influence in Afghanistan, as shown by it hosting a meeting of different Afghan stakeholders even before they undertook US suggested intra-Afghan dialogue in Turkey. Despite a Chinese Central Asian push, using the Belt and Road Initiative, Russian and Indian interests converge in ensuring that Russia retains its foothold in its former territory. India-Iran-Russia have since the Vajpayee government two decades ago had a rudimentary North-South transit corridor mechanism. With Chabahar operational, early sanctions relief for Iran would be in the interest of India, Russia, Central Asia and Afghanistan.Endangering the India-US bonhomie is the announced purchase by India of the $5.5 billion S-400 Russian air defence system. Turkey's purchase of the same caused a major spat with fellow NATO ally US, which cancelled Turkish access to F-35 planes. Although sanctions imposed by Trump in December 2020 fell only on the Turkish institution that manages the defence industry, similar sanctions can stall Indian purchase of 30 weaponised drones that can multiply New Delhi's capabilities to monitor and punish, on land and sea. The Chinese would dread these sentinels, able to stay aloft for 48 hours, to follow Chinese ships and submarines as they exit the Malacca Straits.This new dilemma inverts the challenge India faced fifty years ago when Pakistan began a genocide in East Pakistan. The Soviets became quasi-allies after the Indo-Soviet treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation was signed in August 1971. Unknown to India, Pakistan had won over US President Richard Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger by arranging the latter's secret visit to Beijing in July 1971. The US continued to ignore the massacre of Bengalis, graphically portrayed in the book The Blood Telegram, as the larger game of weaning away China was underway. Today, India is on the side of US to counter China while attempting to retain the goodwill of Russia.Between CAATSA, a domestic democratic decline in India, mounting US-Russia tensions over a cyberwar and Russian interference in electoral processes in Western democracies and a Chinese 'wolf warrior&amp;#8217; syndrome, Indian diplomacy will be tested. Hopefully the US realises that, whatever the nature of government in Delhi, India shall be a friend but never an ally.The author is a former secretary, MEA.

gujarati_test_106,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has directed telecom service providers to take urgent steps to demonstrate visible improvement in quality of service and quality of experience by consumers, including 5G.In a meeting with telecom operators, the authority told telcos to analyse the issue of call muting and one way speech and take corrective action on priority.&amp;#8220;While rolling out the 5G network, TSPs should ensure that there is least disturbance or degradation of quality of service (QoS) of existing telecom services,&amp;#8221; said the TRAI.TRAI held a meeting with major mobile service providers on Friday to review the issues related to quality of telecom services being faced by consumers and the menace of unsolicited commercial communications (UCCI), like pesky calls and text messages by telemarketers.The authority further told the iiiTSPs to closely monitor the incidences of long-duration network outages.&amp;#8220;Such outages adversely affect quality of services and consumer experience.

gujarati_test_107,"Vivo has been aggressively upgrading its mid-budget smartphone lineup. Just before introducing its all-new Vivo T-smartphone series with Vivo Vivo T1 5G earlier this month, the company launched Vivo V23 5G and V23 Pro 5G in India &amp;#8211; both designed for users who enjoy smartphone photography. The two smartphones are also identical in terms of design, but of course, the Pro model is more feature-packed. We&amp;#8217;d reviewed the Vivo V23 Pro recently and found the device to be quite impressive, but some may find the pricing a bit unjustified. Here&amp;#8217;s when Vivo V23 comes into play.ALSO READ: Vivo V23 Pro Review: Colour Changing Phone That PerformsThe regular model features a beautiful design and dual selfie cameras along with fast charging support. Now, these features are more than enough to convince a buyer who&amp;#8217;s looking for a smartphone under Rs 30,000. So, should you consider buying Vivo V23 5G that carries a price tag of Rs 29,990 (8GB + 128GB storage) and Rs 34,990 (12GB + 256GB storage)? Here&amp;#8217;s our breakdown.Vivo V23 5G DesignBefore we start talking about the design, a quick glance at the content inside the box. Apart from the smartphone, the packaging includes a 44W chunky charging brick, USB-A to USB-C cable, and a transparent silicone case. Interestingly, the Vivo V23 5G is one of the rarest mid-budget Android phones that still includes wired earphones along with USB-C to 3.5mm dongle.(Image: News 18/ Abhik Sengupta)We received the Stardust Black edition for our review, and the back panel has a smooth finish that also shines under the sunlight. There&amp;#8217;s also a Sunshine Gold edition that changes colour to blue under UV light. There is no doubt that the Vivo V23 5G is a looker from first glance. The smartphone does resemble the iPhone 12 with a flat edge design, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t look bad by any metric.At the front, we have a 6.4-inch AMOLED with Full HD+ resolution (2400×1080 pixels) and &amp;#8220;protective film&amp;#8221; on top. The screen on the Vivo V23 5G is bright enough even under direct sunlight. We also get an under-screen fingerprint scanner and Face ID &amp;#8211; both are fast and reliable. The selling point of the device is the dual-selfie camera setup with two LED lights next to the notch for better photos and videos under low light settings. We&amp;#8217;ll come to the camera a bit later. The back panel includes an 8-megapixel camera, a 64-megapixel main snapper, and a 2-megapixel super macro camera. At the bottom, there&amp;#8217;s a USB-C port but no headphone jack.(Image: News 18/ Abhik Sengupta)Customers must also note that the Vivo V23 5G does not officially have an IP rating for protection against dust and water. Therefore, be careful using the smartphone outdoors on a rainy day.Vivo V23 5G DisplayThe Vivo V23 5G carries an AMOLED display that delivers good performance if not the best. As mentioned, the screen provides decent brightness under direct sunlight; however, it is not the most colour accurate display available in the market. When you compare this smartphone against rivals like Galaxy M52 5G (roughly Rs 25,000), the display&amp;#8217;s saturation levels are a bit high &amp;#8211; but again, some users may prefer that. I also noticed a strange haze in some videos with vivid colours.Thanks to the HDR10+ support, the black spots are deep in supported videos. However, the refresh on the Vivo V23 5G maxes out at 90Hz, when many rival smartphones are offering a 120Hz refresh rate. If a high refresh rate smartphone is what you&amp;#8217;re looking for, there are loads of options by Samsung, Xiaomi, and Realme.Vivo V23 5G PerformanceThe Vivo V23 5G is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 920 chipset, which is still not present on mainstream smartphones. This chipset competes directly against Qualcomm&amp;#8217;s Snapdragon 778G chipset. On the Geekbench benchmark, the Dimensity 920 falls a little short against the Snapdragon 778G chipset. In the single-core test, the Vivo V23 scored 738 and 2111 in the multicore test. In the graphics department, the chipset paired with Arm Mali-G68 GPU delivered good stability during the intense 3D Mark GPU test, but it did heat up by 6 degrees under high pressure.However, readers must keep in mind that such intense testing in a real-life scenario is rare, so if we keep the number aside, the average users will get a smooth performance. Thanks to the 12GB RAM variant that we received, switching back and forth between apps was seamless.Gaming, on the other hand, wasn&amp;#8217;t as smooth as I&amp;#8217;d hoped for. I did notice some stutters while playing heavy titles like Asphalt 9.Vivo V23 5G CameraThe Vivo V23 5G is heavily banking on its camera system. There are a total of five cameras on board, two at the front and three at the back. We&amp;#8217;ll start with the selfie camera setup that includes a 50-megapixel primary camera with autofocus and an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera. Both cameras deliver good performance, but again there are some caveats.The 50-megapixel primary selfie on the Vivo V23 5G captures great details with high levels of sharpness, though it lacks some colours. When you compare the main front camera on the Vivo V23 5G against an iPhone 12&amp;#8217;s 12-megapixel selfie camera, you can see the difference. In the two photos below, you&amp;#8217;ll notice iPhone 12 offers a warmer, more colour accurate selfie against the Vivo V23 5G. The latter did take a sharp image, but that is not my natural skin tone.iPhone 12 front camera vs Vivo V23 5G front camera (Image: News 18/ Abhik Sengupta)The 8-megapixel secondary camera on the Vivo V23 5G delivers a decent performance, but this time, it sadly loses both sharpness and colours in photos. We get clear images; however, you will see the lacking details once you zoom in. The addition of the spotlight feature is also thoughtful, yet it doesn&amp;#8217;t help much in capturing facial details. The Spotlight can be changed to natural, warmer, and cool colours manually. When it comes to the 64-megapixel rear camera, it performs similarly to the 50-megapixel front camera. We get high levels of sharpness, but again the lack of colour details is a bit of an issue. The good part is that the 8-megapixel wide-angle camera and the 2-megapixel super macro camera perform far better than most rivals. The Vivo V23 5G supports 4K video shooting with the front and main rear snappers.Vivo V23 5G BatteryThe battery performance on the Vivo V23 5G bags mixed reviews. The phone packs a 4,200mAh unit, while the Pro model gets a relatively bigger 4,300mAh battery. Both phones support 44W fast charging and no wireless charging. We managed to get roughly a full day battery with gaming, refresh rate enabled, and other background apps running &amp;#8211; which isn&amp;#8217;t bad at all. It is also not the best when compared to Android rivals that assure a full-day battery backup.Fortunately, the bundled 44W charger can fully charge the device in less than 1.5 hours. So, you can attain at least 60 percent battery in 30 minutes.Vivo V23 5G VerdictSo far, it is obvious that the Vivo V23 is a good performer, though it has its drawbacks. Let&amp;#8217;s start with the obvious ones:The phone lacks an IP rating for dust and water resistance that many rivals at range offerThere&amp;#8217;s only one audio output channel that does deliver loud audio but the clarity isn&amp;#8217;t greatThe Android 12-based Funtouch OS still needs some work in terms of bloatware and spammy notificationsThe good part is that we get great selfie cameras even if they lack colours. The photos and videos are crisp and with attention to other details. This is by far the most reliable camera system that I&amp;#8217;ve seen on a mid-budget smartphone. The charging speed is also good and the almost all-day battery life is acceptable.Overall, if your priority is the cameras &amp;#8211; the Vivo V23 is a good option to consider. If you&amp;#8217;re more productivity-focused and enjoy gaming, a Snapdragon 778G-powered Galaxy M52 5G or even a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-powered Vivo V23 Pro are good options, but the latter is, of course, more expensive.Read all the Latest Tech News and Breaking News here","Vivo એ ભારતમાં Vivo V23 5G લોન્ચ કર્યો છે, જે સ્માર્ટફોન ફોટોગ્રાફીને પ્રાથમિકતા આપતા વપરાશકર્તાઓને લક્ષ્ય બનાવે છે. તેની કિંમત ₹29,990 છે અને તેમાં સ્લીક ડિઝાઇન, ડ્યુઅલ સેલ્ફી કેમેરા અને ઝડપી ચાર્જિંગ સપોર્ટ છે. 6.4-ઇંચનું AMOLED ડિસ્પ્લે સારું બ્રાઇટનેસ પ્રદાન કરે છે અને તેમાં અંડર-સ્ક્રીન ફિંગરપ્રિન્ટ સ્કેનર અને ફેસ આઈડી શામેલ છે.

The report from ESET said that more than 100 different Lenovo laptop models with millions of users worldwide have been found to have these vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to launch UEFI malware. UEFI malware can be extremely stealthy and dangerous, ESET said in its report. It says that this kind of malware can bypass almost all security measures and could prevent Lenovo users from executing operating system payloads. &amp;#8220;All of the real-world UEFI threats discovered in the last years needed to bypass or disable the security mechanisms in some way in order to be deployed and executed,&amp;#8221; said Martin Smolár, the security researcher who discovered the vulnerability.ALSO READ: China-Backed Hacking Group Cicada Is Using VLC Media Player for Cyberattacks. Here&amp;#8217;s How&amp;#8220;The first two of these vulnerabilities - CVE-2021-3970, CVE-2021-3971 - are perhaps more accurately called 'secure' backdoors built into the UEFI firmware as that is literally the name given to the Lenovo UEFI drivers implementing one of them (CVE-2021-3971): SecureBackDoor and SecureBackDoorPeim. These built-in backdoors can be activated to disable SPI flash protections (BIOS Control Register bits and Protection Range registers) or the UEFI Secure Boot feature from a privileged user-mode process during operating system runtime,&amp;#8221; a release from ESET said.ALSO READ: Oil India Systems Hacked; Attackers Demand More Than Rs 57 Crore In Ransom: All DetailsThe third vulnerability, SMM memory corruption allows arbitrary read/write from/into SMRAM, which can lead to the execution of malicious code.

gujarati_test_114,"Samsung could soon have another device added to its Galaxy Wearable fleet. The company has smartwatches and the TWS earbuds in the market, and new reports suggest it could bring a Galaxy Ring for buyers in the near future. Interestingly, the company had got a patent for smart ring back in 2015, which means Samsung always had aspired to have a product in this form, and now app code hints the product could soon become a reality. In fact, the company has reportedly got a trademark for the name Galaxy Ring, which is hardly surprising, when you consider all Samsung's products come under the Galaxy brand name. The patent for the device explained that the smart ring will allow you to control smart home devices, dimming the lights, and other activities, simply by twisting the ring on your wrist. The patent was filed sometime back, and since we didn't hear much about it for years, we thought the product was never coming out. But the new developments suggest otherwise. The Galaxy Ring has been spotted in the Samsung Health Beta app by a Reddit user this week. And since the device has been mentioned in the Health platform, it is likely that Samsung could enhance the features of the rumoured Galaxy Ring and offer health-tracking on the device as well. Rings have become the latest sensation in the health segment, with a slew of startups developing products in this form. Samsung also bringing a Ring device could allow the segment to truly evolve and become a serious entity in the market. The company is already lining up its new foldables at a launch event in Seoul later this month, where we even expect the Galaxy Watch 6 to be showcased, so why not just end all this suspense and just bring the Galaxy Ring to the same event.","સેમસંગ તેના ગેલેક્સી વેરેબલ લાઇનઅપમાં નવા ઉપકરણને ઉમેરવાના છે તેવી અફવાઓ છે કે ગેલેક્સી રિંગ રિલીઝ થઈ રહી છે. કંપનીએ 2015 માં સ્માર્ટ રિંગ માટે પેટન્ટ ફાઇલ કર્યું હતું, અને તાજેતરના એપ્લિકેશન કોડ સૂચવે છે કે આ ઉત્પાદન આખરે વાસ્તવિકતા બની શકે છે. રિંગથી વપરાશકર્તાઓ સ્માર્ટ હોમ ઉપકરણોને નિયંત્રિત કરી શકે છે અને તેમના કાંડા પર રિંગને વાળી અન્ય પ્રવૃત્તિઓ કરી શકશે. ગેલેક્સી રિંગને સેમસંગ હેલ્થ બીટા એપ્લિકેશનમાં જોવામાં આવી છે, જે સૂચવે છે કે તેમાં આરોગ્ય ટ્રેકિંગ સુવિધાઓ પણ હોઈ શકે છે. આરોગ્ય ક્ષેત્રમાં રિંગ્સ લોકપ્રિય બની રહી છે, સેમસંગની એન્ટ્રી આ બજારને વધુ વિકાસ કરી શકે છે."
gujarati_test_115,"In Hindutva's vishwa kutumb (world is family) Muslims are included. On the face of it, this statement by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is welcome, but if you read deeper you realise the Indian Constitution has already included Indian Muslims in the country. 

In Indіa, the safeguards for mіnorіtіes are assured under the Constitution of Indіa in the form of fundamental rіghts. The Constitution nowhere dіscriminates among the citizens of India on the grounds of relіgіon, race, caste, etc and second, the rіghts conferred under Artіcles 25 to 30 are fundamental rіghts. The state іs duty bound to protect it. To be honest, there is nothing new that has been bestowed upon Indian Muslims by him, but wait, Mr Bhagwat, you can do more.

To start with, the Sangh and the Sarsanghchalak can break from the past and denounce and condemn all the anti-Muslim and anti-minority comments made that dehumanised the existence of Muslim minority in the country. If we go by the past record, the dream and aspiration of Hindu Rashtra is based on the exclusion of minorities. As a result the Muslims have been subject to slurs and dog-whistle politics.

There have been political provocations telling us to go to Pakistan. The BJP leaders have made insinuations like choose between 'Ramzadon' (those born of Ram) and 'haramzadon' (illegitimately born). The Muslim and Hindu relationship is seen as 'love jihad', not long ago a Muslim man was publicly beaten for attempting to marry a Hindu. Merely on suspicions of cow slaughter and beef consumption, Muslim men have been beaten and lynched. You will have to say all of this is wrong and should not be repeated to put a moving picture to your words. Will Bhagwat's condemnation prevent all the functionaries of Sangh Parivar from speaking against Muslims. 

The political marginalisation of Muslims is appalling. The BJP has not taken Muslims along, especially electorally. No tickets for contesting state Assembly election and parliament elections were given to the Muslims. There is no point in showing Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain as Muslim poster boys of the BJP. Other than them, the BJP has not enabled the political empowerment of Muslim community.

Lot of work needs to be done in development and political processes. Saying that in the idea of Bharat, Muslims are included is not enough. This is part of RSS doing a lot of public awareness informing everyone about their goals and objectives, and I see this statement as part of that drive, where he is trying to address the fears of the Muslims, which are based on past experiences. 

It has to also undo a lot of action and initiate new actions. The project of vikas should trickle down without religious bias and Bhagwat can tell the PM and the BJP ministers this too.

Though as a Muslim woman I am very happy about the stand of the government in the affidavit in triple talaq case, the government acknowledged that the instant oral and unilateral triple talaq is not essential to Islam. It is not welcome in Muslim countries, and should not be allowed in India as well. The government stood for gender justice for Muslims, and reiterated that Islam considers it incorrect. It really won the heart of several Muslim women. But Muslim women are part of large Muslim society. 

Showing inclusiveness towards the citizens should be the first step for the RSS.

But the terms and jargon involved in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha processes can be difficult to grasp. The News18 series, House Talk, brings you a ready reckoner to make sure that none of it is Greek to you.The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill 2023, which seeks to amend the Forest (Conservation) Act, in the ongoing Monsoon session of the Parliament. The bill seeks to amend the pivotal 1980 conservation law which ensures that the forest land is not used for non-forestry purposes. The legislation exempts certain types of land from the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act like forest land along the international border, a rail line or a public road and to be diverted for strategic projects, amenities and setting up of zoos, safaris and eco-tourism facilities in forest areas.The Forest (Conservation) Amendment Bill-2023 was passed after a brief debate which was responded to by Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav. All About the Forest (Conservation) Amendment BillThe Bill primarily amends the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which regulates the extraction of forest resources including timber and minerals and makes the forest land applicable to other use. These include land notified as a forest under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 or in government records after the 1980 Act came into effect. The bill exempts land up to 10 hectares, proposed to be used for constructing security related infrastructure in border areas. (PTI Photo)However, the main highlight of the act is that it exempts certain types of land from the purview of the Forest Conservation act. To be specific, the bill exempt land within 100 km of the country&amp;#8217;s borders from the purview of conservation laws and can be used for national security projects, small roadside amenities, and public roads leading to a habitation. The bill also allows setting up of zoos, safaris and eco-tourism facilities in forest areas apart from activities like check posts, fencing, and bridges.  What it Means for Strategic Projects?The draft seeks to exempts forest land within 100 kms of India's national borders from the purview of the conservation laws to fast-track construction of strategic and security-related projects.Simply put, the land situated within 100 km along the international borders, Line of Control, or Line of Actual Control, can be used for construction of strategic linear projects for national importance or security. The Bill amends the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 to make it applicable to certain types of land. (PTI Photo)The government further said that the legislation would enable the strategic and security related projects of national importance to be fast-tracked ensuring development of vital security infrastructures near the border areas. Similarly, small establishments, habitations on the side of roads and railways will also be connected to main arterial roads and other public utilities, a government statement said.  The bill exempts land up to 10 hectares, proposed to be used for constructing security related infrastructure, or land proposed to be used for constructing defence related projects, camp for paramilitary forces, or public utility projects as specified by central government not exceeding five hectares in a left-wing extremism affected area. The bill, which was introduced in March, was referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament, which accepted the legislation without any significant changes. (PTI Photo)The bill also seeks to empower the central government to specify, by order, the terms and conditions subject to which any survey, such as, reconnaissance, prospecting, investigation or exploration including seismic survey, shall not be treated as non-forest purpose.

They also pointed out that the country lost 4.2 million hectares of forest land during 1950-1980s due to diversion for non-forestry purposes.","લોકસભાએ ફોરેસ્ટ (કન્ઝર્વેશન) સંશોધન બિલ 1980 પસાર કર્યું, જે 2023ના ફોરેસ્ટ (કન્ઝર્વેશન) અધિનિયમમાં સંશોધન કરે છે. આ બિલ ભારતની સરહદોના 10 કિમીની અંદર વન જમીનને વ્યૂહાત્મક પ્રોજેક્ટ્સ અને સુરક્ષા સંબંધિત માળખાકીય સુવિધાઓ માટે વાપરવાની મંજૂરી આપે છે. તે સુરક્ષા સંબંધિત માળખાકીય સુવિધાઓના બાંધકામ માટે 100 હેકટેર સુધીની જમીનને મુક્તિ આપે છે. માર્ચમાં રજૂ કરાયેલ આ બિલને સંસદની સંયુક્ત સમિતિ દ્વારા કોઈ ફેરફાર વિના પસાર કરવામાં આવ્યું. જો કે, વિદ્વાનો તર્ક કરે છે કે આ હરિત આવરણને ખતરો છે, કારણ કે દેશે 2018-19 અને 2022-23 વચ્ચે ગેર-વન્ય ઉદ્દેશ્યો માટે લગભગ 4.2 મિલિયન હેકટેર વન જમીન પહેલેથી જ ગુમાવી છે."

gujarati_test_118,"As Prime Minister Narendra Modi begins his visit to the United States on June 21, he will be moving closer to breaking the record set by his predecessor, Dr Manmohan Singh, for the number of visits to the country. During his ten-year tenure, Dr Singh made a total of ten trips to the United States, with five visits each during his first and second terms, i.e., on average a visit every year.Prime Minister Modi, so far, has made seven trips since 2014, according to PMO records.Dr Singh embarked on his first trip in September 2004, during which he delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) besides meetings with US President George Bush and President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan.In July and September 2005, he visited the United States for the second and third time, respectively. The first visit of the year was an &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; visit to Washington DC, while the second in September was to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.On July 18, 2005, during his welcome at the White House, President George W Bush praised India&amp;#8217;s economic reforms of the 1990s, in which Dr Singh played a prominent role as the face of those reforms. During the trip, he also addressed the joint session of the US Congress.In 2008, Dr Singh visited the US twice within a span of two months, first on a working visit in September and again in November to attend the G20 Economic Summit Meeting in Washington DC.In his second term, PM Singh represented India at the G20 Economic Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in September 2009 followed by the 'official state visit' two months later.A 'state visit' typically entails a greater level of grandeur and ceremonial protocol compared to an official visit.In April 2010, Dr Singh was in DC to attend the Nuclear Security Summit. The following year, in September 2011, he travelled to New York for the UNGA.After a hiatus of around two years, the Prime Minister undertook his last official working visit to the US in September 2013.Four months into his first term, Prime Minister Modi undertook his inaugural official working visit to the US in September 2014. This four-day (September 26-30) visit, marked several firsts, including a joint op-ed with US President Barack Obama and the PM's memorable address at Madison Square Garden in New York.Prime Minister Modi returned to the US in September 2015, attracting significant attention during the visit. Notably, he became the first Indian PM to visit Silicon Valley, renowned as the epicentre of innovation and IT, where the contributions of Indians are highly praised. The trip generated buzz as the PM attended a Facebook town hall event and visited the headquarters of companies such as Tesla and Google.In 2016, PM Modi visited America twice: first in March-April to the US capital to participate in the multilateral Nuclear Security Summit. This was followed by an official working visit by the Prime Minister. On the trip, the PM also addressed a Joint Session of the US Congress.During his upcoming trip, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will achieve another milestone by addressing a joint meeting of the US Congress for the second time, making him the first Indian Prime Minister to accomplish this feat. Addressing the Congress is one of the highest honours bestowed upon foreign dignitaries by Washington.PM Modi met President Donald Trump for the first time during his fifth trip in June 2017. During this visit, the US President referred to Modi as a &amp;#8220;true friend&amp;#8221;. The Prime Minister became the first international leader to have dinner at the White House with President Trump.In his second term, PM Modi's next visit in September 2019 witnessed a historic event when approximately 50,000 Indians gathered in Houston to listen to him. The grand community summit known as &amp;#8220;Howdy Modi&amp;#8221; had President Trump in attendance, making it the largest-ever gathering with a foreign political leader in the US.In September 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Prime Minister virtually addressed the 75th UNGA session.Upon President Joe Biden&amp;#8217;s invitation, PM Modi returned to America in September 2021.

On the invitation of President Lyndon Johnson, she made her first official visit in March 1966, at a time when India was facing a severe food crisis due to consecutive monsoon failures. During the visit, the US President assured the Indian PM that &amp;#8220;the United States will continue to participate generously in the international effort to alleviate India&amp;#8217;s immediate food deficit problem&amp;#8221;.In her first term as PM, she made two more trips in October 1968 and October 1970 to attend the UNGA.In her second term, Indira Gandhi made her second official visit (fourth overall) in November 1971. The visit garnered more attention due to the strained relationship between the Indian PM and President Richard Nixon.Indira Gandhi&amp;#8217;s next trip was after an interval of 11 years when she arrived in New York for an 8-day official visit in July 1982. Upon her arrival, President Ronald Reagan welcomed her at the South Lawn of the White House. Reagan&amp;#8217;s remark reflected the state of India-US relations at that time.&amp;#8220;Prime Minister Gandhi, we recognise that there have been differences between our two countries, but these should not overshadow all that we have in common, for we are both strong, proud, and independent nations,&amp;#8221; the US President had said.More than a year later, Indira Gandhi visited US soil for the last time in September 1983 for UNGA, in what was a low-key diplomatic affair.India&amp;#8217;s 10th Prime Minister, Atal Bihar Vajpayee, travelled to the US five times during his tenure.

During this five-day visit (September 13-17), the Indian PM also addressed the Joint Session of the Congress.Vajpayee&amp;#8217;s next visit took place just two months after the ghastly September 11, 2001, terror attacks. While en route to the UN, the PM met President George Bush on November 9 at the White House, where both leaders noted that &amp;#8220;since September 11, the people of the United States and India have been united as never before in the fight against terrorism&amp;#8221;.In September 2002 and 2003, Vajpayee visited the US for the 4th and 5th time, respectively.India&amp;#8217;s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited the United States four times. His first visit was in 1949, followed by subsequent visits in 1956, 1960, and 1961.During his first visit in October 1949, Nehru was a guest of US President Harry S Truman. He had the opportunity to meet President Dwight Eisenhower on two occasions, in December 1956 and September 1960. Nehru&amp;#8217;s final visit in November 1961 was hosted by President John F Kennedy.During both his first and last visits, Nehru was received at the airport by the respective US presidents of the time, Truman, and Kennedy. During his inaugural visit, he also spoke separately to members of the House and Senate.Nehru&amp;#8217;s grandson and India&amp;#8217;s 6th Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, also made four visits to the US during his five-year term as PM. Rajiv&amp;#8217;s very first visit in June 1985 proved to be a success with US leaders.Welcoming PM Gandhi to the White House, President Reagan remarked, &amp;#8220;Americans are impressed with what they&amp;#8217;ve seen; your leadership and your idealism are inspiring. We&amp;#8217;re eager to learn more about your vision for India&amp;#8217;s future.&amp;#8221; Gandhi also became the first Indian PM to address a joint meeting of Congress.In October of the same year, Rajiv returned to America to participate in the 40th Anniversary celebrations of the UN.In October 1987, Rajiv made his third visit to the US, which included an official working visit as well as attending the UNGA.

gujarati_test_121,"Apple and Amazon.com must face a consumer antitrust lawsuit in U.S. court accusing them of conspiring to artificially inflate the price of iPhones and iPads sold on Amazon's platform, a federal judge in Seattle ruled on Thursday.In his ruling, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour rejected bids from Apple and Amazon to dismiss the prospective class action on various legal grounds.Coughenour said the &amp;#8220;validity' of the relevant market, a central issue in antitrust litigation, was a question for a jury.The lawsuit, filed in November, is among several private and government actions challenging Amazon's online price practices. Coughenour's ruling means the case will move forward to evidence-gathering and other pretrial proceedings.Lawyers for Apple and Amazon and representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.Steve Berman, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, called the court's ruling &amp;#8220;a major win for consumers of Apple phones and iPads.'The plaintiffs are U.S. residents who bought new iPhones and iPads on Amazon beginning in January 2019. They contend an agreement between Apple and Amazon that went into effect that year restricted the number of competitive resellers in violation of antitrust provisions.In 2018, according to the lawsuit, there were some 600 third-party Apple resellers on Amazon. Apple agreed to give Amazon a discount on its products if Amazon reduced the number of Apple resellers from its marketplace, the lawsuit alleged.Apple has argued that its agreement with Amazon limited the number of authorized resellers to help minimize counterfeit Apple goods being sold on the e-commerce platform.In a court filing, Apple's attorneys called the agreement &amp;#8220;commonplace' and said the &amp;#8220;Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit have routinely recognized that such agreements are procompetitive and lawful.'The judge in Seattle said &amp;#8220;countervailing' motivations for the agreement between Apple and Amazon would be addressed later in the litigation.Apple recorded $94.8 billion in sales in the second quarter, and Amazon reported $127.4 billion in its most recent quarterly earnings report.The complaint seeks unspecified triple damages and other relief.The case is Steven Floyd v Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:22-cv-01599-JCC.","Apple અને Amazonને યુએસમાં એક વપરાશકર્તા વિરોધી વિશ્વાસના કેસનો સામનો કરવો પડશે, જેમાં તેમનો આરોપ છે કે તેઓએ Amazonના પ્લેટફોર્મ પર વેચાતા iPhone અને iPadની કિંમતો વધારવા માટે કાવતરું કર્યું છે. સીએટલના યુએસ ડિસ્ટ્રિક્ટ જજ જ્હોન કોઘેનૌર દ્વારા અપાયેલા ચુકાદાએ બંને કંપનીઓ દ્વારા કેસને રદ કરવાની કોશીષો નકારી કા. નવેમ્બરમાં દાખલ કરાયેલ કેસમાં આરોપ છે કે Apple અને Amazon વચ્ચેના એક સમજૂતીએ પ્લેટફોર્મ પર સ્પર્ધાત્મક રિસેલર્સની સંખ્યાને મર્યાદિત કરી હતી. કેસ હવે પુરાવા-સંગ્રહ અને પૂર્વ-ટ્રાયલ કાર્યવાહી માટે આગળ વધશે. વાદીઓ ત્રિગુણ નુકસાન અને અન્ય રાહતની માંગણી કરી રહ્યા છે.

gujarati_test_126,"There comes a point when people become too exhausted to be afraid. Ukraine appears to have hit that point a few months into the Russian invasion. A year is a very long time now to have remained in panic, or to plunge into panic every time an air raid alert sounds. Or even to step into a shelter.And so every time the siren goes off, most people continue to do more or less what they were doing before. More or less, but not exactly. That is alert enough to remind yourself of the nearest air raid shelter and be prepared to get into it when you hear a blast. That is the real alarm, when a bomb actually falls. For the first it falls on, who did not take shelter earlier, it's what the survivors now calmly call fate. Or to use an expression one would hesitate to in Ukraine today, a game of Russian roulette.DeceptiveBut the calm on the surface, in street behaviour, is deceptive. Stop a little to talk to people and the worry surfaces usually quite rapidly. Not least because most people know someone who is in the armed forces. Ukraine has conscription in place, and if some young male is not already deployed, he soon may be. Families know that, they know the dangers that go with that.Yulia stops for a quick word by a metro station. 'My husband is in the army, he is in the east. I pray day and night to keep him safe for him, for me, and for our little girl.' Dealing with the little one was hardest, she says, on October 10 last year when missiles rained down on Kyiv. 'How do you explain anything to children? This is such a struggle.'At the home of a university professor, an eight-year-old points to his hideout &amp;#8211; it's the laundry attached to the house. 'It's not good enough, it could be better,' he says. 'Because it's not underground, it's not a bunker.'He points to a vent in the ceiling. 'I'm afraid of that,' he says. 'If there is a nuclear attack, the radiation will come in from there.'BraveThe men put up a brave front. 'There is no problem at all,' says a young bank manager. 'Look how we beat away the Russians the last time. And we were not even well-prepared then. Now we are better trained, we have better weapons. We will beat the Russians back, and we will retake all our territory. It's simple.'But clearly, it's not that simple. A meeting at a battalion centre was cancelled only a little ahead of time. 'We are sorry, but there is a situation there that we are handling,' said the spokesperson for the commander. The meeting was not rescheduled. The battalion commander was not expecting to be free for a meeting such as this for several days.Given the spring offensive that is underway already, it could be many, many days before military commanders are free to meet as in near normal times.

The minister issued a directive to the Chief Secretary, instructing him to deploy all officers on both Saturday and Sunday to expedite the processing of the ex gratia sum promised to the flood-affected people and ensure that the money is transferred to their bank accounts by Monday.

gujarati_test_133,"Setting its eyes firmly on seeking a third term for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to implement its biggest voter outreach strategy ever ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.From outreach amongst the Pasmanda (backward) Muslims, to seeking votes of the Christian community in the Northeast and Kerala, the saffron unit is planning a massive public contact programme to implement PM Modi's much-emphasised slogan 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka prayas and sabka vishwas'. If everyone is taken along, why not sabka vote for the saffron unit in 2024 general elections ensuring continuity of this harmony? However, the intent of the effort only seems to be in the right direction. Remember what PM Modi told the leaders at the National Executive recently &amp;#8212; vote or no vote go among them, as they too are living in the same country. In Hyderabad meet, the PM had asked the leaders to expand the horizon and experiment with social engineering.It is here that the PM advised the leaders to reach out to Pasmandas and Christians, communities that were seen as voters of political parties pitted against the BJP. THE PASMANDASThe party feels that Pasmandas are the deprived community among Muslims and the party can achieve electoral success if it projects and achieves public welfare scheme targets for this community. It&amp;#8217;s a hand extended towards a community that needs to understand that they too have chance at better life. The community, which has largely been devoid of any political or social power ever since independence, even by the parties that had used them as vote banks for years, is also being wooed by the ideological parent of the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS). ALSO READ | BJP National Executive: 'Reach Out to Every Section…', PM Modi's Message at Top Meet Ahead of Poll SeasonSangh says it accepts invitation by any Muslim thinker or religious leader who wishes to meet. Election management after all is majorly about arithmetic of caste and religion besides goodwill of the leader in the public. With the outreach already expanding to the OBC, BCs and SCs, the party is also looking to expand its voter base. So that even if a few among the existing might get angry, it should have another bloc to rely upon to win the polls. It says a lot about leadership and organisation that is working on Plan B on weaker seats whereas other parties in opposition are yet to begin on their Plan A. Assuming that opposition too will try to poach voters, the BJP isn&amp;#8217;t waiting for them to do it, rather it is going on the offensive to make way into the communities that opposition believes is their traditional voters. THE NEED FOR BIGGER OUTREACHThe BJP feels that it has touched a saturation point in the number of seats that it has won in north and west India. The party wants to expand in southern and eastern parts of the country to seek more seats and votes for the saffron front. The move is also expected to compensate for any loss of seats in 2024 Lok Sabha polls due to anti-incumbency, where the BJP has been maintaining an over 90 per cent strike rate in 2014 and 2019 general elections.ALSO READ | &amp;#8216;Tis the Season To Woo Christians: Eye on 2024 Polls, BJP Organises Christmas Celebrations​The thought process is clear in the BJP. Main gains in new areas and connect with more voters to successfully counter any loss of seats due to voter fatigue among its strongholds. That is why, an elaborate plan of Lok Sabha pravas of various top leaders and ministers has been put in place in parliament constituencies that the BJP has never won. From PM Modi, Union minister Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh to National President J P Nadda, all have been roped in to ensure that the lost seats can be translated into votes for the party. The party has given its leaders and cadre a combined target of securing 150 Lok Sabha seats in southern and eastern part of the country.   While a strategy for expansion amongst new areas and populations is implemented, the BJP's biggest task would be to successfully take on the opposition propaganda that the saffron unit was anti-minorities. The party hopes to convince these voters by presenting its work in Goa and the Northeast. The BJP is expected to emphasize that voters in these states have rejected opposition propaganda and they should give at least one chance to the saffron unit to serve them.Read all the Latest Politics News here","ભારતમાં ભારતીય જનતા પાર્ટી (બિજેપિ) 2024ના લોકસભા ચૂંટણી પહેલાં વડાપ્રધાન નરેન્દ્ર મોદી માટે ત્રીજો કાર્યકાળ સુરક્ષિત કરવા માટે અત્યાર સુધીની સૌથી મોટી મતદાતા પહોંચની વ્યૂહરચના યોજી રહી છે. પાર્ટી વિવિધ સમુદાયો, જેમ કે પાસમાંદા મુસ્લિમો અને ખ્રિસ્તીઓનો ટેકો મેળવવા અને સમરસતા જાળવવા માટે સંપર્ક સાધવા માંગે છે. બિજેપિ માને છે કે તેણે ઉત્તર અને પશ્ચિમ ભારતમાં સંતૃપ્તિ બિંદુ સુધી પહોંચી ગઈ છે અને દેશના દક્ષિણ અને પૂર્વ ભાગોમાં તેની હાજરી વધારવા માંગે છે. પાર્ટીએ આ ક્ષેત્રોમાં 150 લોકસભા બેઠકો સુરક્ષિત કરવાનો લક્ષ્યાંક રાખ્યો છે."

He said India will accelerate action on climate change only when there is enough support from developed countries via finance and technology.India has already achieved emission reduction of 28% over 2005 levels, against the target of 35% by 2030 committed in its NDC (Nationally determined contributions), India will say at the COP26.Changing GoalpostsIndian officials point out that 'keeping 1.5 degree C alive' became the slogan of the developed countries at Pre-COP26 in Glasgow this year, ignoring the 2 degree C temperature target adopted in the Copenhagen COP15 in 2009.In the 2015 COP21 in Paris, an attempt was made to push the temperature target of 1.5 degree C as preferred over 2 degree C. 'On the issue of mitigation, the developed countries are now pushing to tighten their original weak NDCs and pushing for net-zero commitment by all, which is not needed as per science and Paris Agreement at COP21 in 2015,' government officials said. The Paris Agreement only had voluntary fixing of NDCs with a commitment to a process to promote 'ambition', that Indian officials now say was 'an excuse for increased pressure' on the developing countries.Officials also point out how no finance commitments and technology transfer mechanism has happened since the finance commitment was pinned in 2009 to 100 billion dollars annually by 2020. '6 years down the line from then, the target date for mobilizing 100 billion annually was postponed to 2025. Now, developed countries are trying to retire the negotiation on long-term finance beyond 2025,' the official said. India believes this is to shift the burden on the developing economies like India.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","બ્રિટિશ પ્રધાનમંત્રી 26મી પાર્ટીઓની કોન્ફરન્સ (COP-26) માં હાજરી આપવા તૈયાર છે, જે હવામાન પરિવર્તન માટે વ્યાપક અભિગમની વકાલત કરશે, જેમાં સમાન કાર્બન સ્પેસ વિતરણ, નિરાકરણ અને અનુકૂલન પગલાં, અને હરિત વિકાસ માટે ટકાઉ જીવન શામેલ છે. જોકે, 'શૂન્ય ઉત்ஸર્જન' પર તેમનો વલણ ભારતીય અધિકારીઓની ટીકા પ્રાપ્ત કરી રહ્યો છે, જે માને છે કે આ વિકસિત દેશોના હવામાન કાર્યમાં વિલંબ કરે છે અને વિકાસશીલ દેશો પર ભાર મૂકે છે. તેઓ આ વાત પર ભાર મૂકે છે કે જેઓ દેશોએ ઐતિહાસિક ઉત્સર્જનમાં મહત્વપૂર્ણ યોગદાન આપ્યું છે, જેમ કે યુએસ અને યુરોપિયન યુનિયન, તેમને વધુ જવાબદારી ઉઠાવવી જોઈએ. બ્રિટિશ પ્રધાનમંત્રીએ આગળ G-20 દેશોને 2030 સુધીમાં પ્રતિ વ્યક્તિ ઉત્સર્જનને વૈશ્વિક સરેરાશ સુધી ઘટાડવા માટે આહ્વાન કર્યો છે."

With Rohit having celebrated his 36th birthday recently, he is entering the fag end of his career, and thus there has been speculation regarding who could be handed the captaincy in red-ball cricket as India prepare to kick-start their journey in the WTC 2023-25 cycle with the upcoming two-match Test series against West Indies.Former BCCI chief selector MSK Prasad has thrown Virat Kohli&amp;#8217;s name in the fray for Test captaincy,  citing the example of Ajinkya Rahane who was recently appointed vice-captain for the West Indies Test series following his return to red-ball cricket via the WTC final.While Rohit is the designated captain across all three formats, Hardik Pandya has been captaining the T20I team with BCCI looking to manage the workload of Rohit and Virat, neither of them have been named in the squad for the five-match T20I series against the Caribbean side.ALSO READ| Virat Kohli Reveals &amp;#8216;Favourite Memory&amp;#8217; Against West Indies, Recalls &amp;#8216;Special&amp;#8217; Meeting With Viv RichardsHowever, Pandya doesn&amp;#8217;t play Test cricket, and therefore, it remains to be seen whether Rohit will continue to lead the red-ball team or if the BCCI will make a change in guard.MSK Prasad however feels if the selectors are indeed planning to replace Rohit, then Virat might just be the ideal choice given his track record.&amp;#8220;Why not Virat Kohli? When Ajinkya Rahane can come back and become the vice-captain, then why not Virat Kohli? I don't know what the mindset of Virat is on captaincy.

gujarati_test_138,"Millennials as a generation have always been known for welcoming cultural and societal changes, in layman's language the &amp;#8220;woke&amp;#8221; generation. While today's sedulous youth is busy carving their ways out in bustling cities and occupied lives, caring for their mental health was pushed on the back burner until the alarming Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020.The pandemic not only challenged our health infrastructure but the constant isolation, deaths of loved ones, and the fear of catching the infection pushed everyone to the brink of psychological trauma, regardless of age. Experts warned that a historic wave of mental-health problems was approaching — depression, substance abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. However, the unprecedented health crisis also acted as an eye-opener,  making people focus on both physical and mental health. Thanks to technology, getting professonal help has now been made easier.During the mental health week, to talk about the broad spectrum of issues surrounding mental health and awareness, News 18 reached out to the CEO and Co-founder of Mumbai-based mental health organisation- Trijog- Arushi Sethi. Twenty-six-year-old Sethi is a media graduate and began her entrepreneurial journey in 2015. In her interview, she talks about her own journey, how we can eradicate the stigma around mental health and how she dealth with PTSD.Edited excerpts from the interview:How and when did you decide to use your entrepreneurial skills and begin your journey with Trijog? Could you elaborate on your six-year-long journey?There comes a moment in everybody's life where they sit up and reflect into understanding, 'how could the skills that they hone orchestrate change on a larger scale?' It was after observing my mother closely transform lives while growing up, personally going through a life and death experience, successfully overcoming PTSD, and working through my anxiety, I realised that it was time, in 2015, to take the entrepreneurial beacon forward and make sure that this knowledge and service reach millions of others as well. It was then that we decided, we must start an organisation that can increase the accessibility and service of mental healthcare in our country as well as globally.One thing that the past 6 years have truly taught me- 'Having faith, removes fear; Having patience, helps you persevere; and showing gratitude, helps one attract greatness'.In every entrepreneur's journey, It is very important to understand that one will face numerous challenges, but your intention and vision need to be clear. Clarity is extremely important- to turn intention into action. Reminding myself constantly of these few learnings has definitely helped me hold space in this journey.&amp;#8211; Walking the talk and delignating your limitless vision.&amp;#8211; Extreme Resilience in bouncing back from any setback.&amp;#8211; People Management; Building authenticity and an attitude of ownership, complete responsibility, and creating anenvironment of trust and understanding.&amp;#8211; Being committed to what you've set out to do, no matter whatever hurdle or obstacle comes your way.If the last six years have taught me anything, it is that there is always a solution if there's a problem, but only if you&amp;#8217;re willing to find it. Hard work is the answer. There is so much in growing ourselves, every day, becoming a better version of who we are in order to extend better and do better.As a millennial mental health advocate, how do you think the stigma around mental illness can be dealt with?The moment we need to deal with any stigma, the truth is, we need to eradicate it with education, communication and conversation around it. I believe that acknowledgement, acceptance, and understanding the concept is equally important. Only and if we are empowered we are in a position to help empower others. So, as a generation, we need to take responsibility for ourselves that each of us becomes a Mental Health Champion, and once you know how to feed your own mind, you will definitely know how to care for the rest.The real change will be brought when emotional health is taught in schools, on an educational level, when the government begins investing in mental health on a priority basis, the companies or workplaces begin investing in the emotional health of their employees.How was your experience of dealing with PTSD post-Nepal earthquake, would you have any suggestions for someone who is going through a similar experience?Initially, the experience was extremely daunting, to feel an upsurge and such constant and strong emotions. The best tool that equipped me was&amp;#8211; taking therapy to become aware of how I am feeling as well as to work towards transforming those feelings into actions. For anybody who&amp;#8217;s experiencing PTSD, my advice would be to get professional help because there are so many things about our own lives and so many emotions breeding inside that we have absolutely no idea about. So it's best to involve the experts in the process of channelising our emotions from unhelpful to helpful ones, who know the science behind it and could help us give the right direction in life.As a co-founder of a leading psychotherapy venture, what would be your advice to the country&amp;#8217;s youth who are dealing with stress, anxiety, and substance abuse?Dear youth,It is amazing for me to see that we have begun to recognise and accept our feelings, anxieties, our stress, and substance use what we have subjugated ourselves to. Identification is the first step to bringing about an optimal level of functioning by learning how to effectively deal with stress and the anxiety we go through.Stress is caused by extrinsic and intrinsic factors in our life, extrinsic factors are those that are outside of us and present in our immediate environment, (the pandemic) (the wifi) (weather conditions) how we think of them generally causes one stress. This stress manifests itself into our body and takes multiple forms, which we call anxiety, fear, restlessness and numerous other names. There are also certain intrinsic factors that usually add to our stress. External factors are generally out of our circle of control, but the internal factors, which are mainly our thoughts, feelings, and actions, are in our circle of control. How we think about a situation leads to the way we feel about it and our reaction v/s a reason.Knowing this fact that our thoughts lead to our feelings, and feelings to actions is the key to help us move into a helpful thought pattern so we lower our stress and anxiety levels. Learning, and understanding what kind of thoughts work for you, is something that I would encourage us all to do.Therapy is, undoubtedly, one of the best ways to understand, acknowledge and align our thoughts, feelings, and actions, for which the principal aim is to identify and implement what is best for our beautiful bodies and minds!With the pandemic worsening mental health situation, how do you think Indian mental health infrastructure can be improved, as the treatment opportunities are limited to Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities?When tier 1 cities, corporations, and insurance companies start opening up themselves, this is a mandatory thing to take up services for ensuring one's healthy emotional quotient so that their employees can be benefited through their budgets. But there is no doubt that when it comes to tier 2 and tier 3 populations, mental health services remain inaccessible. This access will be open to them only when our government intervenes and takes up serious initiatives towards the cause.Today, we don't even have provisions for Mental Health care in the bills and budgets that are being sanctioned in our country. So we are working towards making Mental Health Care services more affordable and accessible for the tier 1 segment. Once that reception is achieved, we can reach out to the next tier segment in another 5 years as hoped.Trijog, as an organisation, looks towards reaching out to the grassroots level to make sure that therapy at subsidised and affordable rates can be provided to all.Read all the Latest News , Breaking News and IPL 2022 Live Updates here.","અરૂષિ સેથી, ન્યુયોર્ક સ્થિત માનસિક આરોગ્ય સંસ્થા ત્રિજોગના સીઈઓ અને સહ-સ્થાપક, કોવિડ-19 મહામારીના માનસિક આરોગ્ય પરના પ્રભાવ પર ચર્ચા કરે છે. 35 વર્ષીય મીડિયા સ્નાતક સેથીએ 2010 માં તેમની ઉદ્યોગસાહસિક યાત્રા શરૂ કરી હતી. તે હૈતિના ભૂકંપ પછી PTSD નો સામનો કરવા તેમના અનુભવને શેર કરે છે અને થેરાપીના મહત્વ પર ભાર આપે છે. સેથી ભારતના ટિયર 4 અને 5 શહેરોમાં માનસિક આરોગ્ય સંભાળવાની જરૂરિયાતને પણ હાઇલાઇટ કરે છે. તે સૂચવે છે કે ત્રિજોગ વધુ વ્યાપક પ્રેક્ષકો સુધી પહોંચવા માટે 2 USD પ્રતિ સત્રની કિંમત પર થેરાપીને સગવડ બનાવવાની દિશામાં કામ કરી રહ્યો છે."

Other generative AI chatbots like Microsoft Bing and Google Bard are also covered by the ban.Bloomberg&amp;#8217;s Mark Gurman notes that Samsung is &amp;#8220;concerned' about data being sent to generative AI platforms, including Google Bard and Bing, because it is stored on external servers.

gujarati_test_141,"Heinz Guderian- the famous German General- who also led the Panzers across the Dnieper river at Kopys during World War II had once stated, 'If the tanks succeed, then victory follows.' However, since the beginning of the Ukraine War, most analysts have been talking about the 'demise' of the tank and questioning its centrality in light of the proclaimed success of drones, Javelins and other anti-tank weapons. In fact, while condemning the brutality of the war in Ukraine, Pope Francis in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera said that the Russians are discovering that 'their tanks are useless.' Ironically, we now see a scramble by Ukraine to obtain the latest tanks.The onset of the winter has now provided the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) a narrow window to arm Ukraine to repel an anticipated Russian springtime offensive. They are, therefore, moving fast to give them sophisticated weapons they had earlier refused, for fear of provoking Russia.The sense of urgency over sending more powerful weapons reflects the grim standoff on the battlefield in Eastern Ukraine, where the Russians are trying to seize the city of Bakhmut and the surrounding area but have only made incremental gains. Though they have been successful in Soledar&amp;#8211; a salt mine town inhabited by 10,000 people.Over the last few weeks, one barrier after another has fallen, starting with an agreement by the United States in late December to send the Patriot Air Defence System. That was followed by a German commitment last week to provide a Patriot missile battery and then France, Germany and the United States each promised to armoured fighting vehicles, mainly the Bradleys to the front line for the first time.Now the spotlight is on the induction of modern Western tanks to the growing list of powerful weapons being sent Ukraine's way. Until now, Ukraine has relied primarily on Soviet-era T-72 tanks. These also include T-72 tanks given by the NATO countries that were members of the Warsaw Pact. In fact, Poland has given them 260 T-72 tanks of various modifications as per the statement by Polish President Andrzej Duda during the discussion panel 'Defending Europe' at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.Under the so-called 'Ringtausch' programme, a swap scheme, Eastern NATO partners supplied the Ukrainian Army with Soviet-era tanks like the T-72 in exchange for the Leopards from Germany, and the exchange rate was not one-for-one. However, most of Ukraine&amp;#8217;s tank fleet has been destroyed and has suffered wear and tear due to the prolonged conflict, and is running low on ammunition, which is incompatible with Western munitions.The impasse over tanks now seems to be ending with the UK announcing that it would be sending 14 Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, making it the first country to send Western-made battle tanks to Kyiv. While countries like Poland, Finland and the Baltic states have also openly endorsed re-exporting Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine from their own stocks, they require Germany's permission to do so.President Zelenskyy thanked the UK for its support, saying the decision would 'not only strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield but also send the right signal to other partners.' 'Somebody always has to set an example' is what he told the Polish state-run broadcaster TVP Info.Russia has reacted with fury, saying that all the units that the UK plans to send 'will burn' and 'do nothing to alter the outcome of its nearly year-long war.' Vladimir Solovyov, a presenter on the Rossiya-1 state television channel said the UK had 'de facto entered the war' with its move to supply the units. 'I consider Britain is now a legitimate target for us,' he said.While Ukraine has been requesting sophisticated tanks since the start of the war, the push to satisfy those pleas gained speed as the British and Polish governments publicly urged a change in the Western alliance's stance. While the British have agreed to send a small number of tanks, the Polish government said it would happily send some of its Leopard tanks, though Germany would need to allow it.Ukraine hopes that the increased pressure will persuade Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz to authorise the export of German-made Leopard 2 tanks, held by other NATO allies, to Ukraine. The tanks are among the most coveted weapon platform and if inducted in significant numbers, they would substantially increase Ukraine's capabilities.A German Defence Ministry spokesman said no decision had been made by the government of Chancellor Scholz, a Social Democrat. But his coalition partners&amp;#8211; the Greens and Free Democrats&amp;#8211; support sending the tanks.Norbert Röttgen, an Opposition German Legislator and foreign-policy expert, has predicted that Scholz would give in on the Leopards under pressure from allies, as he did earlier with German-made howitzers and tracked armoured infantry fighting vehicles.Scholz and his party 'wants to keep a relationship with Russia and with Putin for the future, and think that if they give Ukraine the best Germany has, Russia will perceive this as breaking a special relationship,' Röttgen said. 'But pressure from allies is becoming too strong,' he added.Germany has been tight-lipped about the tanks despite increasing pressure and criticism. However, German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall (which makes the main gun for the Leopard 2) tried to manage mounting expectations of a decision on tanks, with the chief executive of the firm telling a German newspaper that Leopard 2s from Germany's industrial reserves would not be ready for any kind of delivery before 2024.There are an estimated 2000 Leopard tanks in more than a dozen countries across Europe and some could be shipped to Ukraine, though Ukrainian crews would have to be trained in using them.In Ukraine, officials say armoured fighting vehicles will play a key role in battles for control of the fiercely contested towns and cities in the Eastern provinces. Ukraine's General, Valeriy Zaluzhny, said 'the nation needs some 300 Western tanks and about 600 Western armoured fighting vehicles to make a difference.'There is no hiding the fact that tanks are logistics intensive. Moreover, the logistics for each type of tank varies not only as per the type of ammunition fired but also the fuel. Logistics sustenance, thus, plays a critical role in their employment. Then there is the issue of maintenance and repairs&amp;#8211; both of which require a huge inventory. For example, while the T-72 and T-90 have a 125mm smoothbore gun, the Challenger 2 has a 120 mm rifled gun and the Leopard 2 has a 120 mm smoothbore gun manufactured by Rheinmetall. The US operates the M1 A2 which also has a 120 mm smoothbore gun, the quantities of which far outstrip the Challenger and Leopards tanks but they are seen unsuitable for Ukraine as they are driven by gas turbine engines. A handful of Challenger 2s, taken from the UK's existing fleet of 227, would not in itself make much difference on the battlefield, but it would be the first time any Western country has agreed to send its own heavy armour to Ukraine. However, the Challengers have maintenance issues and the UK would be hard-pressed to replenish its stocks.Altering the balance of forces in Eastern Ukraine is needed to break the stalemate in the war and modern Western battle tanks and other combat vehicles could tip the balance. Without tanks, a powerful component of ground warfare, it is unlikely that Ukraine will be able to win back significant amounts of territory.Ms Laura K Cooper, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence, last week at a briefing said, 'We absolutely agree that Ukraine does need tanks. This is the right time for Ukraine to take advantage of its capabilities, to change the dynamic on the battlefield.'Plans to send German-made Leopard tanks and UK Challengers to the front lines in the Donbas have been greeted by the Ukrainian forces, who have been taking heavy casualties in recent weeks, around Bakhmut.'There were very heavy losses. It&amp;#8217;s very pitiful. It&amp;#8217;s hard,' said an officer in charge of repairing tanks for the 24th Mechanised Brigade. He said the current deadlock would not be broken unless foreign tanks arrive in significant numbers. 'We&amp;#8217;ll be stuck here. We need these Western tanks to stop Russia&amp;#8217;s aggression. With infantry, covered by tanks, we&amp;#8217;ll win for sure,' he said.Battle tanks designed by the NATO countries such as Challenger 2 and Leopard 2 would provide Ukrainian forces with better protection and more accurate firepower. However, they would not provide an instantaneous boost in terms of combat capability because the Ukrainian forces would need to be trained to use any tanks supplied by the West, a process that is likely to take several weeks, if not longer. Conversion is a long drawn-out process focussed at an individual level, graduating to crew integration, sub-unit training and thereafter integrated and joint training. There is also the issue of maintenance and repairs, both of which have their own complexities.With Russian troops fortifying their positions in occupied parts of Ukraine's East and South and probably preparing for a new offensive in the months to come, battle tanks would provide Ukraine with a means to better defend itself and potentially make breakthroughs on the battlefield.With the sudden resignation of Germany's Defence Secretary, Christine Lambrecht, the decision on providing tanks is likely to be on top of the agenda of her successor Boris Pistorius.While there have been narratives regarding the future of war based on the emergence of high-technology weapon systems and futuristic visions of battles contested in cyberspace and by other non-kinetic means, it is unlikely that an outcome of a conflict can be controlled without the use of force. The fact remains that to be able to constantly create criticalities for the enemy in all phases of operations, you need the tank. There is no doubt that in war, violence still dominates.The author is an Army veteran.

gujarati_test_144,"Xiaomi India will be launching a new smart TV in the country under its Mi TV brand. The new MI TV Horizon Edition will be the latest addition employing the same thin-bezel design philosophy that we saw on its Mi Notebook 14 range. As per teasers, the new Mi TV Horizon Edition will come with features like 'Quick Wake' along with Android TV paired with the company's PatchWall user interface. The all-new Mi TV Horizon Edition will be launched via a virtual event in the country. The event kicks off at 12PM Noon and you can head over to Xiaomi India's official Facebook page or YouTube channel to catch all the announcements. We have also added the live stream below for your convenience. Xiaomi India's TV Product Manager Sudeep Sahu recently gave some information around the new upcoming TV where is said that the company had to start from scratch and redesign the front frame to ensure that it is sturdy at the same time reducing the bezels as much as possible. A dedicated product page suggests that the new TV is going to feature 'quintessential display tech&amp;#8217; which means a superior panel. This could either be the use of higher-end panels like OLED or QLED or just fine-tuning of the existing TV panels. Just a few days back certain specifications of the upcoming TV were leaked which are kind of disappointing if you were expecting a high-end offering from Xiaomi. Expect a thin design and frame along with an inverted V-shaped stand. As mentioned above, it will be running on Android TV 9 software, alongside Patchwall UI. At least one model is expected to come in a 43-inch variant featuring a full-HD LED display, a Cortex-A53 processor, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of storage. Other features expected on the new TV include three HDMI ports, two USB-A ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and an Ethernet port. It is also expected to come with 20W speakers with DTS-HD technology and the usual set of Android TV features like built-in Chromecast, Google Assistant, Google Data Saver and a large library of apps.","Xiaomi India તેનું નવું સ્માર્ટ ટીવી, Mi TV Horizon Edition, લોન્ચ કરવા માટે તૈયાર છે, જેમાં પાતળા બેઝલ ડિઝાઇનની વિશેષતા છે. ટીવી 'ક્વિક વેક' જેવી સુવિધાઓ સાથે આવશે અને Xiaomi ના PatchWall યુઝર ઇન્ટરફેસ સાથે એન્ડ્રોઇડ ટીવી પર ચાલશે. કંપનીએ બેઝલ્સને ઘટાડવા અને મજબૂતાઈ સુનિશ્ચિત કરવા માટે ફ્રન્ટ ફ્રેમને ફરીથી ડિઝાઇન કરવી પડી. ટીવીમાં શ્રેષ્ઠ પેનલ હોવાની અપેક્ષા છે, શક્ય છે OLED અથવા QLED. લીક થયેલી વિશિષ્ટતાઓ સૂચવે છે કે 43-ઇંચ વેરિઅન્ટ ફુલ-HD LED ડિસ્પ્લે, Cortex-A53 પ્રોસેસર, 1GB RAM અને 8GB સ્ટોરેજ સાથે આવશે. અન્ય સુવિધાઓમાં HDMI અને USB પોર્ટ, 20W સ્પીકર્સ, અને બિલ્ટ-ઇન ક્રોમકાસ્ટ અને Google Assistant શામેલ છે."
gujarati_test_145,"Aggression by pro-Khalistan groups has increased not just in India but worldwide, say officials. This is being displayed in the name of &amp;#8216;Khalistan referendum&amp;#8217;. Religious places of Hindus are under constant threat of attack from such groups in countries like Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, officials say.Despite repeated attempts by the Indian government of conveying concerns to these friendly nations during bilateral talks and other forums over anti-India forces planning so-called referendums in their country or attacking religious places, officials say very little has been done on the ground in terms of action on such groups, prosecution of culprits, and banning such events.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has put a stop to criticism of all those who had the opinion that India is unable to put pressure on foreign governments to act against pro-Khalistan groups. At a prime ministerial level perhaps for the first time, this issue was raised during bilateral talks with Australia, and in fact, during remarks to the media, PM Modi chose to mention the attack on temples and security concerns of the Indian community in Australia is seen as an unprecedented and pressure-building move by India on Australia to make the authorities there act on the ground.The message is loud and clear for other countries as well that in the future if they don&amp;#8217;t respond to the concerns, then the issue of the safety of religious places and NRIs will be raised at the prime ministerial level.In the media statement, PM Modi said it is a matter of regret that reports of attacks on temples have been coming regularly from Australia over the past few weeks and it is natural that such news would worry everyone in India.&amp;#8220;I conveyed these feelings and concerns to Prime Minister Albanese and he has assured me that the safety of the Indian community is of special priority for him,&amp;#8221; Modi said in the presence of the Australian PM.The NRI community and Indian diaspora have welcomed the Prime Minister&amp;#8217;s stance.&amp;#8220;As an Australian Hindu, I thank Narendra Modi ji for raising the issue of Hindu temples being attacked in Australia. Nationalists are being attacked too for carrying the tricolour while extremist Khalistanis who attack them are roaming freely,&amp;#8221; says Sandeep Dhankar, who is originally from Karnal in Haryana but is based in Melbourne, Australia.Sachin Gaur, another NRI based in Australia who was injured during clashes at Melbourne&amp;#8217;s Federation Square in January, appreciated the PM&amp;#8217;s stance. &amp;#8220;Thank you, sir, for raising it with the Australian PM. Hopefully, the perpetrators would be punished and the Indian-Australian Hindu community can feel safe again,&amp;#8221; he said.The Australian Hindu Association has raised certain demands:1) Arrest of perpetrators in four cases of attacks on temples and Federation Square.2) Prosecution of culprits. Only in the Federation Square case 2 culprits were arrested, but were fined and released soon after.3) Public inquiry of Khalistani groups to learn more about their funding and connections in terms of booking lavish venues, organising vehicles, etc.4) The government should call out the names of pro-Khalistan groups active in Australia as they organised most of these events anonymously.5) After the &amp;#8216;referendum&amp;#8217; in Melbourne, Khalistani groups have planned a similar event on March 19 in Brisbane. Indian nationalist groups have asked Australian authorities to stop the event.6) Weapons like swords, etc, are brandished by these groups. They should also be brought under the ambit of law.&amp;#8220;While Narendra Modi ji raising the issue of the safety of Australian Hindus and attacks on our temples is commendable, words must translate into action. There has not been a single prosecution of the Federation Square Khalistani attackers or temple attackers,&amp;#8221; said the Australian Hindu Association in a statement on social media.Amrendra Singh, president of the Australian Hindu Association, said, &amp;#8220;In the Federation Square referendum case, the Indian community was peacefully protesting when they were attacked by Khalistani groups from behind, and despite giving names and evidence in the form of videos, no arrest has been made in that matter.&amp;#8221;At least five cases of vandalism of Hindu temples in Australia have been reported this year:1) January 12: BAPS Swaminarayan Temple in Melbourne was attacked, The walls of the temple were defaced with spray paint, and anti-India and anti-Narendra Modi slogans.2) January 17: Shiva Vishnu Temple in Carrum Downs was vandalised, graffitis were drawn, and anti-India and anti-Modi slogans were drawn on the walls.3) January 23: Hare Krishna temples being run by ISKCON were attacked. Anti-India, anti-Modi slogans were drawn, some hailing Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale.4) February 16: A woman priest of Kali Mata Temple near Melbourne received a warning not to organise a bhajan event of singer Kanhiya Mittal.5) March 4: Shree Laxmi Narayan Temple in Brisbane was targeted. Miscreants wrote anti-Hindu, anti-India, and pro-Khalistan slogans on the walls.The issue also erupted after Haryana native Vishal Jood, who took on Khalistani protesters in Australia two years ago while trying to protect the Indian flag, was arrested and jailed. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar wrote to the foreign minister, and after much effort, Jood was released and sent to India.While addressing the media, foreign secretary Vinay Kwatra reiterated PM Modi&amp;#8217;s clear message to Australia. &amp;#8220;The Prime Minister has conveyed to the PM of Australia that this is something which disrupts peace and harmony in both our societies. They have appreciated our sensibilities and assured us of a response and officers from both sides will remain in constant touch.&amp;#8221;The Indian community in Australia has welcomed this strategy of PM Narendra Modi to use bilateral talks as a platform for raising the issue of the safety of the Hindu temples and community. They believe that since it has been mentioned at the highest level, the results could be seen on the ground in terms of police action against Khalistani forces and pending cases of vandalism.Read all the Latest India News here","અધિકારીઓના જણાવ્યા મુજબ, ખાલિસ્તાની સમર્થક જૂથો વિશ્વભરમાં આક્રમક બની ગયા છે, જેમણે ઓસ્ટ્રેલિયા, કેનેડા અને યુકે જેવા દેશોમાં હિન્દૂ ધાર્મિક સ્થળોને નિશાન બનાવ્યા છે. ભારત દ્વારા આ દેશોને તેમની ચિંતાઓથી અવગત કરવાનો પ્રયાસ છતાં, આ જૂથો સામે ઓછું પગલાં લેવામાં આવ્યા છે. ભારતીય પ્રધાનમંત્રી નરેન્દ્ર મોદીએ તાજેતરમાં ઓસ્ટ્રેલિયામાં દ્વિપક્ષીય ચર્ચાઓ દરમિયાન આ મુદ્દો ઉઠાવ્યો, મંદિરો પરના હુમલા અને સુરક્ષા ચિંતાઓ અંગે દેશ પર દબાણ મૂક્યું. ભારતીય વંશજોએ મોદીના વલણનું સ્વાગત કર્યું છે અને ધરપકડ, પ્રોસિક્યુશન અને ખાલિસ્તાન સમર્થક જૂથોની પ્રવૃત્તિઓની જાહેર તપાસની માગણી કરી છે. આ વર્ષે ઓસ્ટ્રેલિયામાં મંદિરોની તોડફોડના અનેક કિસ્સાઓ નોંધાયા છે."
gujarati_test_146,"It is an old adage: if you come for the king, you best not miss. Apart from suicide, a coup d&amp;#8217;état is a crime in which people get punished if they fail. Pakistan&amp;#8217;s former Prime Minister Imran Khan's unforgivable crime is that he targeted the real rulers of the country - the Pakistan Army and their chief - and missed. Now the military establishment and the incumbent regime are going after him with a vengeance. The odds are stacked heavily against him. The Pakistan Army is in an unforgiving mood, which has become clear in a series of press releases issued by the spokesman of the military. But the latest statement issued after the meeting of the Formation Commanders - the entire top brass of the Pakistan Army - is the most ominous for Imran Khan.The Army brass is in a really ugly mood and has made it clear that it will not only hold military trials of the 'perpetrators' of the attacks on military installations on May 9, but also the 'planners and masterminds' behind the 'rebellion against the state and state institutions.' Simply put, the Army has Imran Khan in its crosshairs and is accusing him of waging war against the state of Pakistan - a crime punishable by death. What's more is that the Army has issued a warning to the cabal of judges led by Chief Justice of Pakistan, Umar Ata Bandial, that it will not allow anyone to obstruct or stymie whatever it has in store for those who had the temerity to challenge the Pakistan Army and target its bases.In the last month since Imran's failed putsch, the Pakistan Army and government have pulled out all stops to dismantle Imran's political vehicle, Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI). Using brute force, blackmail, and intimidation (including arrests of family members, raiding of residences, misbehaviour with women folk and even detaining them), the PTI is being stripped of all political leaders of any consequence. A virtual deluge of desertions has hit the PTI, denuding it of a bulk of its second and third-rung leaders. Such tactics have been deployed in the past against the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) after the 1977 coup, Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) after the 1999 coup, and Altaf Hussein's Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) in 2016 after a controversial speech.But even by Pakistani standards, the speed at which the PTI has been disintegrating in Punjab and to an extent in Sindh is quite breathtaking. Some of the most vocal and visible, if also vitriolic and vacuous, 'leaders' like Fawad Chaudhry, Ali Zaidi, Fayyaz Chohan, Aamir Kayani, Murad Rass and Imran Ismail have dumped Imran and PTI after a bit of arm twisting by the ISI and local police. Many of the Punjab leaders - most of them very boastful and full of bluster - couldn't bear even a couple of days in jail, and jumped ship. Some of them like former ministers Shireen Mazari and Maleeka Bokhari have renounced politics. Few holdouts in Punjab are under enormous pressure to quit or face the consequences. The only place where the PTI leaders haven't quit en masse, so far, is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. But even there, it is a matter of time before the military establishment engineers a breakaway faction that takes away a bulk of the electable leaders.In Punjab, a new party - Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party (IPP) - under Imran's estranged former right-hand man, financier and political trouble-shooter Jehangir Tareen has been set up. Just as politicos were corralled into PTI by the military in the years leading up to 2018 and after the elections in that year, the deserters of PTI have been 'instructed' or 'encouraged' to join Tareen's IPP. According to some accounts, efforts by some of the deserters to form their own small groups have been nipped in the bud and they have been told to go with Tareen or else… As far as the party workers are concerned, they have had to face really nasty treatment reserved for the Hoi Polloi in the 'Land of the Pure'. They have been left defenceless by the party which, in any case, has disintegrated.The crackdown has so far only targeted Imran Khan politically, not personally. But that is only a matter of time. He has managed to avoid being arrested, in part, because the focus is on draining out his street support, and in part because of the cover given to him by a coterie of judges who are his loyalists. These judges have uncharacteristically gone against the military. But something has got to give in the next few days or weeks. The kind of blatant bias being displayed by the judges cannot be sustained for very long. But as long as the Army stays within the four corners of the law, its hands will be tied behind its back in trying to move against either Imran or the judiciary. Neither warnings nor threats seem to be working either on the judges or even on Imran who remains defiant. It isn't clear if the defiance is because he is unhinged or because he is confident, or even because he has decided that if he has to go, he will, in a blaze of glory with the halo of a martyr. There are reports that the Army has tried to even offer Imran an exit route - distance himself from politics, hand over the reins of the party to someone else, go into exile - but he has refused to take it. Perhaps once the judiciary is tamed, Imran will read the writing on the wall. But it is a big if.In the good old days, the military would not have hesitated in making short work of Imran. But times have changed and any drastic or precipitate action could easily backfire badly on the military. This is why the Pakistan Army is trying to stay within the constitutional framework while fixing Imran Khan. Even so, there is no way the Army will allow Imran to stay in active politics. Even the possibility of letting do any kind of back-seat driving is practically non-existent. Although the Army is reducing PTI into a shell, as long as Imran is around, even the shell is dangerous. The thing is that while the Army might have built up Imran, his support base is now much bigger than what the Army passed on to him in the form of electable leaders. This vote base is not going to be transferrable to anyone without him. The new party, IPP, will impact Imran organisationally but whether it will do that politically remains to be seen. Imran's support base has three components: diehard loyalists, the electables vote and the floating vote. His loyalists aren't deserting him in any significant numbers yet; the electables are no longer with him; the floating vote will split but Imran is expected to get a substantial chunk of it. How this plays out at the hustings between Imran and the other parties is a toss-up. But because it is all so iffy, the military will not want to take a chance of Imran either sneaking back into power or even holding the balance of power.The Army is also not comfortable with the two older established parties - PMLN and PPP. They have therefore forged the IPP in the hope that it will be able to emerge as a third force and hold the balance of power more accurately, allowing the military to hold the balance of power. This means that the military establishment is trying to ensure that as and when elections are held, no party emerges with a majority. In other words, a split mandate is what the Army wants. The fragmentation of politics might be in the best interest of the military but doesn't augur well for the country. The weak governments that will result from this political engineering will hardly be in a position to take the terribly tough decisions that are required if an economic meltdown is to be prevented.Compounding the problems for the Army is the fact that the PMLN supremo Nawaz Sharif appears to have become wise to the Army's political games. The PMLN feels that if the Army is preparing the field to cut it to size, then it must lay enough minefields that the Army gets caught in the web it is spinning. The budget for the year 2023-24 seems to be designed towards that end. It throws fiscal responsibility to the winds. It is a populist budget, albeit on an empty treasury and a sinking economy. The can will have to be carried by the caretakers who will take the reins of government from the PMLN and lead the country into elections. The caretakers will have to reverse the populist measures in the PMLN budget if they want to enter into a new IMF programme, which will have its own political repercussions.Throwing the book at Imran and neutering him politically is unlikely to bring the stability that Pakistan desperately needs. If anything, Pakistan could be facing even greater instability in the weeks and months ahead, with the economy melting down, the politics unmanageable and terrorism becoming uncontrollable. Neither an election, nor a selection, and not even a coup d&amp;#8217;état will be able to solve the predicament that Pakistan is facing because the entire state structure is working at cross-purposes.The writer is Senior Fellow, Observer Research Foundation.

gujarati_test_148,"In the Shahbad Dairy area of Delhi, a macabre spectacle unfolded on the evening of May 28, 2023, leaving the nation shocked and shaken to its core. A 16-year-old girl, Sakshi Dixit, was brutally killed, marking a tragic end to her dreams of becoming a lawyer. Sakshi, a beacon of aspirations, was en route to a friend&amp;#8217;s son&amp;#8217;s birthday celebration, blissfully unaware of the nefarious plot that was about to ensnare her. A seemingly ordinary Sunday took a sinister turn when she was accosted by Mohammad Sahil Khan.As Sakshi was waiting for her friend Aarti, Sahil, her alleged ex-boyfriend approached her with a carefully orchestrated plan to end her life. This blood-curdling act, captured fastidiously by a CCTV camera—that consequently went viral on social media, throwing the nation into a pit of shock and horror—saw Sahil unleash a ruthless and unflinching assault on Sakshi. In an act of incomprehensible brutality, Sahil stabbed Sakshi over 20 times, later bludgeoning her head with a boulder. As per reports, Sahil Khan conscientiously planned the murder, having purchased a long knife 15 days before the crime and the alleged argument that happened on Saturday. But extremely distressing was the sight of bystanders and passersby who made no attempt to intervene. Their apathy stood starkly against the heinous crime being perpetrated in their vicinity.Sahil Khan, an AC mechanic by profession, who led a lifestyle of hard partying, drinking, and making Instagram reels, was arrested on Monday in Uttar Pradesh&amp;#8217;s Bulandshahr city. According to the Delhi Police, the motive behind the brutal murder was reportedly Sakshi&amp;#8217;s decision to end their estranged relationship. Unravelling the intricacies of the crime, friends of Sakshi shared chilling details about her relationship with Sahil. Sakshi knew Sahil as a Hindu boy, a claim further supported by Sahil&amp;#8217;s appearance during his arrest — he had a Kalava (a Hindu sacred thread) tied around his wrist. He even wore a Rudraksha mala in some older pictures. These were the revelations that pointed towards 'love jihad.' Once the victim discovered his true identity, she began to distance herself, which goaded the Muslim boy to butcher the Hindu girl.As we grapple with the horrific reality of Sakshi Dixit&amp;#8217;s murder, it is crucial to delve deeper into the untold story — the silent war that is love jihad. A term often dismissed as propaganda by many, including an influencer, who infamously trivialised the issue in his critique of the telling movie The Kerala Story. He insisted that the narrative, which highlighted the plight of just three victims, was not representative of the true state of affairs, echoing a sentiment that resonates with the Leftist ecosystem. This is a narrative that continues to be peddled by certain factions of the media who relish a ritzy lifestyle bankrolled by their followers&amp;#8217; funds; take immense pleasure in Moroccan footballers bending to offer namaz on the FIFA ground; but frown and howl upon PM Modi paying respect to the Sengol, a symbol of justice, with a humble dand pranam.Below are some of the multitudes of cases that have been perpetuated in the very last week, and veritably, they missed hitting eyeballs!On May 20, in Manchar, Maharashtra, Javed Sheikh, a 22-year-old Muslim man, was arrested for the abhorrent acts of abducting, sexually assaulting, and forcefully marrying a minor Hindu girl.The news of Abdulla Akbar Momin from Changa abetting a 22-year-old Hindu girl from Dakor to end her life as he blackmailed and harassed her was merely covered by a few local portals in Gujarat on May 21.On May 22, a Muslim woman and her Hindu husband were attacked in Bilari town, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, for their interfaith relationship.In Bhubaneswar, Odisha, a protest was held against love jihad on May 28, following a case where a Hindu girl alleged her Muslim boyfriend had brainwashed her into converting to Islam under the false promise of marriage.On May 28, a 23-year-old pregnant Dalit woman, Seema Gautam, was raped and poisoned to death in Shahjahanpur district, Uttar Pradesh, by Mohd Naved Iqbal, who posed as a Hindu to lure her into a relationship. He started forcing her to convert, and when she denied it, he poisoned and killed her.In this murky world, there are women like Asifa from The Kerala Story, working in tandem with local imams connected to extremist factions in Pakistan and Afghanistan, all operating under the guise of human rights. There are influencer interfaith couples, a Muslim man and a Hindu woman who might be in love with no element of love jihad but will play a disarming role in the psyche of victims like Shraddha Walker.There&amp;#8217;s no denying the existence of a deeply embedded Islamist ecosystem that would go to any lengths to shield individuals like Sahil. It is the same ecosystem that protected Tausif, who murdered Nikita Tomar in 2020 for refusing to convert to Islam, and Aftaab Poonawala, a self-proclaimed liberal, who horrendously mutilated Sharddha into 35 pieces. Islamist organisations rally behind these criminals with legal support, enabling international media to whitewash their crimes with headlines that scream 'Muslims under attack.' For all we have seen in this world, liberal secularists and militant Islamists make for strange bedfellows.Sakshi&amp;#8217;s murder should leave us ruffled with haunting questions about women&amp;#8217;s safety, the truth of interfaith relationships, and the larger ecosystem that harbours support for the demoniacal crimes against Hindus and humanity at large at the hands of Islamists. The unseen war of love jihad rages on, and it is time we opened our eyes to it. It is also necessary to make the younger generation understand the manipulative warfare being waged against them in the name of 'love'.Yuvraj Pokharna is an independent journalist and columnist.

gujarati_test_150,"The recent article in Panchajanya which makes extreme statements against Infosys is unacceptable and a result of narrow-mindedness that sees a conspiracy behind every shadow. The fact of the matter is that there is a challenge with the portal developed by Infosys. The matter has to be resolved and is in the process of being resolved. The portal is a very large complicated IT system which involves lakhs of users and complex transactions. Obviously, the portal suffers from deficiencies and the public has been inconvenienced because of the portal going live prematurely, resulting in glitches. Every large system anywhere in the world will have challenges like these of varying intensity. But for a magazine to use this opportunity to abuse a company and call it anti-national and fomenting social dissent etc. is totally shocking and uncalled for. A magazine that seems to be affiliated to a particular organisation&amp;#8217;s vichaar (views), which in turn is associated with the ruling alliance in the country, carries certain connotations, which may cause worry to industries in India. But as far as I am concerned, I would see this as an unnecessary, uncalled-for article by people with a narrow mindset, who have not made an objective assessment of the issue and tried seeing a conspiracy where none exists. ALSO READ: Role of Infosys in India&amp;#8217;s Development Crucial, &amp;#8216;Panchajanya&amp;#8217; Not Mouthpiece of Sangh, Says RSS Amid ControversyMy personal view is that this government has done a tremendous amount of work for Indian industries and businesses, such as banning Chinese apps to create space in India&amp;#8217;s digital territory so that Indian start-ups can benefit and they have benefitted; to create Aatmanirbhar policy for Indian businesses which suffered from bad policy; and to rein in the practice of China dumping cheap goods in India and hurting local Indian businesses. The last government did not take a tough stand on Chinese goods or ensured a level-playing field for Indian companies. This government has taken several steps to ensure a level-playing field for Indian businesses and industries. The PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme and several other such schemes have promoted Indian industries. This government also brought Indian industries into defence manufacturing, a truly Aatmanirbhar moment.  It is but natural for any country to try and protect its own industry. Even the United States, supposedly the freest economy in the world, has put in a lot of barriers to force its consumers to buy American and created conditions where other countries cannot compete freely, etc. This is a normal feature of global trade. Policy making is a continuous process and over a short span, the Indian industry has become globally competitive. This government has played a key role in that with reduction in interest rates, reduction in cost of capital, better logistics, better infrastructure. Against such confidence-building measures, unfair and uncalled-for, bordering on abusive, statements by a journal affiliated with the ideological fountainhead of the ruling alliance is bound to create dissonance in the Indian industry. ALSO READ: RSS-Linked Journal Accuses IT Giant Infosys of Allying With &amp;#8216;Naxals, Tukde-Tukde Gang&amp;#8217;. Here&amp;#8217;s WhyMy personal view is that we must all stand up and condemn such statements, which make value judgments against one of India&amp;#8217;s best companies. A company that has set standards for India and continues to do so. We must also make sure that we have deeper engagement with the government on policy matters so that the industry understands the expectations of the government and vice-versa. Indian industry needs a level-playing field to become more competitive globally and to create future jobs. In closing, I would say that the article in Panchajanya is in extremely bad taste. We must be critical of it, but we must also carry on with our lives and work with the government to make better policies and help India grow.The author is an Infosys veteran.

gujarati_test_151,"Opera is set to enter the AI chatbot arena by using the popular ChatGPT in its products. The integration will happen later this year and the company has not exactly talked about the details of its plans for the AI chatbot. The fact that Opera wants to use the capability of ChatGPT hardly comes as a surprise. That's because of the vote of confidence that Microsoft has given Open AI by investing billions and integrating ChatGPT into Bing and Microsoft Edge browser recently. Opera's parent company Kunlun Tech confirmed this plan, saying that all of its products will be integrating with ChatGPT, which is likely to include Opera as well. Opera has a variety of web browsers in the market, and like Microsoft Edge, we expect ChatGPT to make its mark on the Opera browser and probably few other products that the company offers. To be fair, Opera is not among the top choice of web browsers these days, with a miniscule share among the peers. Google leads the segment with Chrome but when you talk about Opera, the browser is even behind the likes of Mozilla Firefox and Samsung's Internet browser. We've already seen what integrating ChatGPT could do for a product like Bing that has been around for years but couldn't compete with the likes of Google in the search arena. Now, with ChatGPT under its wing, Bing has run into a waitlist of people eager to try out the new experience offered by the search engine. Opera does have other non-browser products as well but we're not sure how ChatGPT could enhance its profile, performance and image in any way.  Apple is still the big absence from all the recent AI talk. The company has reportedly held a secretive meeting with its employees to gauge its readiness in the AI segment but we'll probably have to wait till the WWDC 2023 later this year to know more about the company's plans.Read all the Latest Tech News here","ઓપેરા તેના ઉત્પાદનોમાં OpenAI ના ChatGPT ને એકીકૃત કરવાની યોજના બનાવી રહ્યો છે, જે Microsoft ના તાજેતરના રોકાણને અનુસરે છે. આટલી શક્તિશાળી AI ટેકનોલોજીના સંભવિત દુરુપયોગ વિશે ગંભીર ચિંતાઓ ઉભી થાય છે. ઓપેરાના ઉત્પાદનો, જેમાં તેનો બ્રાઉઝર પણ સામેલ છે, બજારમાં નાનો હિસ્સો ધરાવે છે, અને આવા સંદર્ભમાં ChatGPT ની ક્ષમતાઓના અસરો અસ્પષ્ટ છે.

A run out further dragged the contest deep with two runs needed off the last two deliveries.Sophie Ecclestone paddled the penultimate delivery for a four to seal the deal.This was after a brilliant 93-run partnership between Dayalan Hemalatha (57 off 33 balls) and the second costliest player Ashleigh Gardner (60 off 39 balls) helped GG post a challenging 178/6 at the Brabourne Stadium.The authority and attacking ways with which the duo played indicated they were on a mission, given the do-or-die nature of the contest as the tournament enters its business end.By the time the partnership ended, with Hemalatha dismissed by Parshavi Chopra in the 17th over with the team total on 143, the stand had put the team on course for a big total.South African opener Laura Wolvaardt and Sophia Dunkley went about their task of scoring runs in powerplay with a lot of urgency. Runs flowed freely while the two batting stalwarts were at the crease, with Wolvaardt smacking a fine boundary off just the third ball of the opening over bowled by left-arm pacer Anjali Sarvani.The 23-year-old used the width on offer to steer it past backward point, making her intentions clear. Just two overs into the match and Gujarat Giants were in overdrive, with the team having scored 26 runs.Also Read: ICC Releases Schedule for Men&amp;#8217;s Cricket World Cup Qualifier PlayoffsThe powerful six by the South African off a length delivery outside off stump from left-arm India spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad in the second over had class and power written all over it.Soon England batter Dunkley took charge, giving a further fillip to the scoring rate. By the time Wolvaardt was dismissed for 17, knocked down by a length delivery from Sarvani, the pair had put up an opening partnership of 41 in just four overs.The UP side recovered from the initial onslaught as they reduced the Giants to 50 for three at the end of powerplay. Dunkley was the next batter to depart on the first ball of the sixth over, slicing a flighted delivery from Gayakwad to third man where Sarvani did the rest.Harleen Deol (4), after threading one past point for a boundary, was dismissed on the last ball of the same over as the young India batter was caught by Simran Shaikh at cover point.With such a flourishing start, 50/3 in powerplay overs looked mediocre. But new batters, Hemalatha and Gardner ensured a quick flow of runs.The Giants&amp;#8217; 100 came in the 11th over with Gardner clearing deep midwicket to deposit a big six into the cow corner. The flurry of boundaries and sixes continued with monotonous regularity with the pair dispatching virtually every loose delivery to the ropes.With PTI InputsGet the latest Cricket News here","યુપિ વૉરિયર્સે ગુજરાત જાયન્ટ્સને ત્રણ વિકેટથી હરાવીને ડબલ્યુપીએલ 2023 પ્લેઓફમાં અંતિમ સ્થાન મેળવ્યું. ગ્રેસ હેરિસે 41 બોલમાં 72 રન બનાવ્યા અને તાહલિયા મેકગ્રાથે 38 બોલમાં 57 રન બનાવીને યુપિડબ્લ્યુને 179 રનની પીછો કરતા વિજય પ્રાપ્ત કર્યો. આ જીતે ગુજરાત જાયન્ટ્સ અને રોયલ ચેલેન્જર્સ બેંગ્લોર બંનેને પ્લેઓફની દોડમાંથી બહાર કરી દીધા. દયાલન હેમલતા અને એશ્લી ગાર્ડનરની 93 રનની ભાગીદારીએ જીજીને 178/6 ના પડકારજનક સ્કોરમાં મદદ કરી. જો કે, યુપિડબ્લ્યુની મજબૂત બેટિંગ પ્રદર્શનએ તેમને રોમાંચક મુકાબલામાં વિજય અપાવ્યો. સોફી એક્લેસ્ટોને અંતિમ બોલ પર બાઉન્ડરી મારીને જીત સુનિશ્ચિત કરી."

gujarati_test_155,"On June 23, heads of 15 Opposition parties assembled in Patna to discuss a strategy to defeat Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. These parties all agree that PM Modi and BJP are 'anti-democratic' and have to be defeated in the 2024 polls to protect democracy and the soul of the Constitution. Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who herself was one of the attendees of the meeting, even said that 'if BJP wins in 2024, India will exist no more and there will be no more elections.'Attacks on Opposition for Daring to contest elections in BengalThis statement of Mamata Banerjee comes at a time when, in her own ruled state, there have been countless incidents of attacks on Opposition candidates of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), BJP, Congress and Indian Secular Front for contesting in the rural body polls, which are to be held on July 8.On the last day of filing nominations, when CPM and Congress workers and supporters were on their way to submit nominations in Chopra block of North Dinajpur, a young CPM activist, Mansur Alam, associated with the party's youth wing — Democratic Youth Federation of India — died after he was hit by a bullet fired by miscreants, allegedly belonging to the TMC. Importantly, the ruling TMC has won uncontested all 217 seats of Gram Panchayat and all 24 seats of Panchayat Samiti in this block. It also won uncontested all three Zila Parishad seats falling under the Chopra Panchayat Samiti.Obviously, this can't be denied that the organisation of the Opposition isn't at par with the TMC across the state but it is also true that there were intimidations and attacks on Opposition workers and supporters to prevent them from filing nominations — the developments of Chopra block are a prominent example of this.Continuous process to weaken OppositionAccording to the TMC, the Panchayat elections have always been marred by violence — and it blames the previous CPM-led Left Front rule for this. It is true that the most number of people — 76 — died in the 2003 Panchayat elections and in Murshidabad, which was then a Congress stronghold, 45 people were killed in the violence. Ironically, it was the then-ruling party, CPM, which suffered the maximum casualties at 31. Five years later, this number dropped to 30 but then in 2013, the first panchayat elections under the TMC rule, the number rose to 39 and dropped to 30 in 2018.In terms of winning uncontested seats, the then-ruling Left Front won 11 percent in 2003 and this number dropped to 5 percent in 2008. However, after the TMC came to power, this percentage rose. The ruling TMC won 11 percent seats uncontested in 2013 and then in 2018, the number went to an all-time high — with TMC winning 34 percent seats uncontested. This time, it dropped with the TMC winning 12 percent uncontested. Still, these numbers are higher than that of the Left rule.Also importantly, during Left rule, the Opposition parties had their strongholds still. Murshidabad and Malda — and also North Dinajpur — were mostly known as Congress strongholds. On the other hand, TMC remained a strong force in Kolkata and its neighbouring urban areas. However, since the TMC came to power, there have been attempts to weaken the Opposition by luring their elected members — including MLAs, corporators, Zila Parishad members and Panchayat members — to join the ruling party. The Left Front had several times alleged that its members were lured through money by the ruling party leaders. Not to forget that since 2011, many Opposition MLAs joined TMC without even resigning from their seats, while maintaining in the state assembly that they belong to the party on whose symbol they were elected. The speaker of the assembly didn't even disqualify those MLAs in the last 13 years, despite the fact these defections fell under the disqualification law. This hasn't happened in the past in the state on such a large scale. This was to systematically weaken the Opposition so that no political force could challenge the dominance of the TMC, which expanded its empire across the state.A Pliant State Election Commission?Former state secretary Rajiv Sinha was appointed the State Election Commissioner and within 24 hours, without even holding an all-party meeting at the block, district or state level, he announced the Panchayat elections for around 73,000 seats and said that the polls would be held in a single phase. What a joke of democracy! No wonder the main Opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari alleged that the commission is working at the behest of TMC — this same allegation is repeated by CPM and the Congress too.The Calcutta High Court too was forced to pull up the Election Commissioner and even remarked that he could resign from his post if he was unable to conduct his role properly. This remark came days after the Election Commission went to the Supreme Court challenging the Calcutta High Court's order for the deployment of central forces, although the apex court also upheld the order of the high court, dealing a blow to the narrative of the TMC that the law and order of the state is 'absolutely fine'.Doesn't this remark from the high court point towards the State Election Commission, a constitutional body, becoming pliant? What does it say about the status of democracy in the state? Let's not forget that in 2013, the then State Election Commissioner Mira Pande even went to the Supreme Court against the Mamata Banerjee government, to deploy central forces in the Panchayat elections, only to ensure that voters were able to exercise their voting rights as enshrined by the Constitution of the country. But this time, the commission did the opposite. Remember, there were no central forces in the 2018 Panchayat elections and we all know how democracy was brutally attacked then.Disturbing silence from the Opposition leadersFormer Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who is always busy attacking Modi for weakening democracy in the country, is silent on West Bengal — despite the fact that his party leaders and supporters too have been facing attacks just for contesting elections! Phoolchand Sheikh, a Congress worker from Murshidabad, was killed on the first day of filing nominations. But the national leadership of the grand old party is silent as support of the TMC is needed to defeat the BJP. Such are the priorities. The same goes for the CPM. Although the party's general secretary Sitaram Yechury attacked the TMC for its tactics to prevent the Opposition from contesting elections, he too doesn't have problems with the TMC joining the anti-BJP front nationally. Bihar Chief Minister and JDU supremo, Nitish Kumar, aspiring to play the role of legendary socialist leader Jay Prakash Narayan, who led the Opposition against authoritarian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, is also completely silent on the situation of Bengal.This shows that this Opposition unity — with many leaders setting their eyes only on the chair of the prime minister — is all about capturing power and the principles of the Constitution don't matter to them in that way as they often claim. If the principles of Babasaheb Ambedkar had been a priority, they would have definitely condemned the attacks against democracy taking place in Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's West Bengal, where the minds of the Opposition candidates and their families and the common voters are filled with fear as the date of voting keeps approaching.Sagarneel Sinha is a political commentator and tweets @SagarneelSinha.

gujarati_test_157,"Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will appear in a special court at the capital&amp;#8217;s police headquarters on Wednesday to address graft accusations, a day after his detention sparked widespread demonstrations. Khan&amp;#8217;s imprisonment comes amid months of political turmoil, and came just hours after the strong military chastised the former international cricketer for suggesting that a top soldier was involved in a plan to assassinate him.Protesters vented their rage on the military, torching the corps commander&amp;#8217;s mansion in Lahore and laying siege to the army&amp;#8217;s general headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.At least one person was reported killed in clashes between protesters and the military in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, with another five people wounded there, while about 15 injuries were reported amid similar violence in Karachi, Peshawar, Rawalpindi and Lahore. Police fired tear gas to disperse demonstrations.Amid the developments, let&amp;#8217;s understand why Khan is appearing in court and what are the allegations against him:Why Was Khan Arrested?Khan has faced dozens of charges since being ousted in April &amp;#8212; a tactic analysts say successive Pakistan governments have used to silence their opponents.He could be barred from holding public office if convicted, which would exclude him from elections scheduled for later this year. Khan&amp;#8217;s arrest came a day after the military warned him against making &amp;#8220;baseless allegations&amp;#8221; after he again accused a senior officer of plotting to kill him.The rebuke late Monday underscored how far Khan&amp;#8217;s relations have deteriorated with the military, which backed his rise to power in 2018 but withdrew its support ahead of a parliamentary vote of no confidence that ousted him last year.Khan was removed from the Islamabad High Court by security agents from the National Accountability Bureau, said Fawad Chaudhry, a senior official with Khan&amp;#8217;s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, and then shoved into an armored car and whisked away, as per a report by the Associated Press.She said Khan has been arrested on corruption charges and he is accused of taking property in exchange for providing benefits to a property tycoon in the country. She denounced attacks at offices of the military and at public places by Khan supporters, saying it was done 'in an orchestrated manner on Imran Khan's directions.'Imran Khan protest goes global &amp;#8211; A large number of Pakistanis are protesting Imran Khan's arrest in front of Nawaz Sharif's house in London. pic.twitter.com/34V68Ak46G&amp;mdash; Ashok Swain (@ashoswai) May 9, 2023Chaudhry denounced the arrest of the 71-year-old former cricket star as 'an abduction.' Pakistan's independent GEO TV broadcast video of Khan being hauled away. A scuffle broke out between Khan's supporters and police outside the court. Some of Khan's lawyers and supporters were injured in the melee, as were several police, Chaudhry said.Khan was taken to Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, for questioning at the offices of the National Accountability Bureau, according to police and government officials. He also was to undergo a routine medical checkup, police said.Khan had arrived at the Islamabad High Court from nearby Lahore, where he lives, to face charges in the graft cases. He has denounced the cases against him, which include terrorism charges, as a politically motivated plot by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, saying his ouster was illegal and a Western conspiracy. Khan has campaigned against Sharif and demanded early elections.Tuesday&amp;#8217;s arrest was based on a new warrant from the National Accountability Bureau obtained last week in a separate graft case for which Khan had not been granted bail. His lawyers challenged the legality of the arrest, but the court upheld it, although it added that Khan should not have been forcibly removed from the courtroom. Khan is scheduled to appear at an anti-graft tribunal on Wednesday, officials said.'Imran Khan has been arrested because he was being sought in a graft case,' Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan told a news conference. He alleged Pakistan's treasury had lost millions of dollars while Khan was in office due to illegal purchases of lands from a business tycoon.What is the NAB?The National Accountability Bureau is Pakistan's powerful anti-corruption organization that has detained and investigated former officials, including prime ministers, politicians and retired military officers. But some view the NAB as a tool used by those in power, especially the military, to crack down on political opponents. When Khan was in power, his government arrested Sharif, then the opposition leader, through the NAB.At a news conference, Law Minister Azam Tarar said Khan was arrested because he was not cooperating with the investigations. He also denounced the violence by Khan supporters, saying that protests must remain peaceful.The Graft Case Against KhanThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has been in the crosshairs for buying gifts, including an expensive Graff wristwatch he had received as the premier at a discounted price from the state depository called Toshakhana and selling them for profit.As per a report by Indian Express, the Toshakhana controversy resurfaced in August 2022, when the coalition government, led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), filed a case against Imran, alleging that he failed to disclose information on gifts given to Toshakhana as well as the proceeds from the 'illegal&amp;#8221; sale of some of the gifts.Toshakhana is a department under the administrative jurisdiction of the Cabinet Division that preserves presents and other expensive objects received by public authorities, the report explains. It was established in 1974 and is mandatory for officials to declare gifts and other such materials received to the Cabinet Division, according to its rules, it adds.However, when Imran came to power in 2018, he refused to reveal details of the numerous gifts he received throughout his tenure, claiming that doing so would jeopardise relations with other countries, the report says.Following that, the former prime minister issued a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) admitting to selling at least four such gifts but also claiming to have purchased them from the government for a percentage of their value. The Saudi crown prince had given him a Graff watch, as well as Rolex watches, exquisite cufflinks, a rare pen, and a ring.Protesters&amp;#8217; WrathAs the news of the arrest spread, about 4,000 of Khan's supporters stormed the official residence of the top regional commander in Lahore, smashing windows and doors, damaging furniture and staging a sit-in as troops there retreated to avoid violence. The protesters also burned police vehicles and blocked key roads.Protesters also smashed the main gate of the army's headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where troops exercised restraint. Hundreds of demonstrators shouted pro-Khan slogans as they moved toward the sprawling building.In the port city of Karachi, police swung batons and fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of Khan supporters who had gathered on a key road.Raoof Hasan, another leader from Khan's party, told Al Jazeera English television that the arrest is 'blatant interference in the judicial affairs by the powers-that-be.&amp;#8221; Hasan added that Khan &amp;#8220;was virtually abducted from the court of law.'Khan&amp;#8217;s arrest came hours after he issued a video message before heading to Islamabad, saying he was 'mentally prepared' for arrest there.Khan was wounded by a gunman at a rally in November, an attack that killed one of his supporters and wounded 13. He has insisted, without offering any evidence, that there is a plot to assassinate him, alleging that Pakistan&amp;#8217;s spy agency was behind the conspiracy. The gunman was immediately arrested and police later released a video of him in custody, allegedly saying he had acted alone.In a strongly worded statement Monday, the military accused Khan of 'fabricated and malicious allegations' of its involvement in the November shooting, saying they are 'extremely unfortunate, deplorable and unacceptable.'The military has directly ruled Pakistan for more than half of the 75 years since the country gained independence from British colonial rule, and wields considerable power over civilian governments.Sharif, whose government faces spiraling economic woes and is struggling to recover from last year's devastating floods that killed hundreds and caused $30 billion in damage, slammed Khan for assailing the military.'Let this be abundantly clear that you, as former prime minister, currently on trial for corruption, are claiming legitimacy to overturn the legal and political system,&amp;#8221; Sharif tweeted after Khan&amp;#8217;s arrest.AFP, Associated Press contributed to this reportRead all the Latest Explainers here","પૂર્વ પાકિસ્તાનના વડાપ્રધાન ઇમરાન ખાને તેમના ધરપકડ બાદ ભ્રષ્ટાચારના આરોપોનો સામનો કરવા માટે કોર્ટમાં હાજર થવાનું છે, જેની ધરપકડ બાદ વ્યાપક વિરોધ પ્રદર્શન થયા હતા. ખાને એક વરિષ્ઠ અધિકારી પર તેમની હત્યાની સડયંત્ર રચવાનો આરોપ મૂક્યા બાદ તેમની ધરપકડ કરવામાં આવી હતી, જેનાથી સેનાની ટીકા થઈ હતી. ધરપકડને રાજકીય વિરોધીઓને મૌનમાં કરવા માટે વપરાતી કૌશલ્યના હિસ્સા તરીકે જોવામાં આવે છે. જો દોષિત ઠરવામાં આવે છે, તો ખાને જાહેર પદ ધારણ કરવા માટે પ્રતિબંધિત કરી શકાઈ શકે છે, જેનાથી તેઓ આગામી ચૂંટણીમાંથી બહાર થઈ જશે. પાકિસ્તાનની ભ્રષ્ટાચાર વિરોધી સંસ્થા, નેશનલ એકાઉન્ટેબિલિટી બ્યુરો,એ અનેક પૂર્વ અધિકારીઓને કબજામાં લીધા અને તપાસ કરી, જેના કારણે કેટલાક લોકોને આને રાજકીય વિરોધીઓ પર કાર્યવાહી કરવા માટે વપરાતું સાધન તરીકે જોવામાં આવે છે."
gujarati_test_158,"In a new ruling aimed at direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television operators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has stated that all set top boxes (STBs) provided to customers will have to be mandatorily interoperable. In other words, no matter which DTH operator a user subscribes to, the STB provided with the connection must not be linked to one particular operator, as is the state of the industry right now. TRAI has further stated that the Ministry of Information &amp; Broadcasting (I&amp;B) may also amend the erstwhile rules set for India's satellite TV operators, in a bid to compulsorily facilitate interoperability. The interoperability norms will come into effect once the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown is lifted.

However, the move appears to have attracted considerable opposition from major DTH operators in India. A report on the matter by CNBC-TV18 quoted a Tata Sky representative, who said, &quot;It is not desirable to have interoperable STBs for the commercial, technical, security and service-related reasons. There is no proven global model of interoperability available. It is anticipated that interoperable STBs would turn out to be a much more expensive proposition for the subscribers. Also, the interoperable STB would stifle individual operator's ability to innovate.&quot;

As a user, such a ruling effectively means that the same STB can be used to switch from one operator to another.

Fellow operator Dish TV has also echoed similar sentiments as an immediate response to the TRAI ruling, stating that the idea of interoperability of STBs is &quot;highly misplaced&quot; and will cause &quot;difficulty in operations&quot;. As a user, such a ruling effectively means that the same STB can be used to switch from one operator to another. However, it is not yet clear as to how the STBs will be procured. So far, the boxes are provided by operators against a one-time fee, which adds to their revenue stream as well. Doing away with that may put both users and operators in a tight spot in terms of cost effectiveness of TV services.

However, TRAI's decision appears to have been rolled out in concrete footing. In light of its ruling, the I&amp;B ministry and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) have been asked to coordinate and roll out a ruling that compulsorily requires all television sets sold in India to come with USB ports and facilitate the use of interoperable (and possibly even 'smart') STBs. With the rise in smart TV sets and connection-ready TVs even in budget segments, facilitating such a move would seem easy for new TV buyers. However, in light of the economic slowdown, it remains to be seen if millions of older TV set owners would find it acceptable if they are mandated to upgrade their STBs and TVs.

The TRAI ruling, as stated before, has been mandated to be made applicable &quot;prospectively&quot;, which suggests that the new rules will not be enforced until the present crisis situation is resolved. Within such time, it remains to be seen how DTH operators react to the situation, and what steps do they take to comply with the TRAI ruling.","ભારતીય દુરસંચાર નિયમક પ્રાધિકરણ (TRAI) એ જાહેરાત કરી છે કે તમામ સેટ-ટોપ બોક્સ (STBs) જે ડાયરેક્ટ-ટુ-હોમ (DTH) સેટેલાઇટ ટેલિવિઝન ઓપરેટર્સ દ્વારા પ્રદાન કરવામાં આવે છે, તેઓ ઇન્ટરઓપરેબલ હોવા જોઈએ. આનો અર્થ એ છે કે ગ્રાહકો તેમના STB બદલીને અલગ અલગ DTH ઓપરેટરો વચ્ચે સ્વિચ કરી શકશે. પરંતુ, મુખ્ય DTH ઓપરેટરો જેમ કે ટાટા સ્કાય અને ડિશ ટીવી, વ્યાવસાયિક, તકનિકી અને ખર્ચ સંબંધી ચિંતાઓ દાખવીને આ ચુકાદાનો વિરોધ કર્યો છે. માહિતી અને પ્રસારણ મંત્રાલય ઇન્ટરઓપરેબિલિટીની સુવિધા માટે નિયમોમાં ફેરફાર કરી શકે છે. આ ચુકાદો COVID-19 લોકડાઉન ખતમ થયા પછી અમલમાં આવશે, પરંતુ DTH ઓપરેટરો કેવી રીતે પ્રતિસાદ આપશે તે જોવાનું બાકી છે."

Thankfully, it&amp;#8217;s not the plot itself that&amp;#8217;s caused for the scene to go viral on social media but perhaps an oversight on the part of the makers. Or perhaps they didn&amp;#8217;t account for eagle-eyed Twitter users to spot what book the actor in the scene was reading. In the scene, the protagonist, Gul, reads- casually and with a smile on her face- a copy of Mein Kampf. Yes, the one by Adolf Hitler. In the actual scene, though, not much smiling is going on since Gul is going through a tough time. Twitter users, however, have zeroed in on the particular moment where she appears to be beaming.Mein Kampf is an infamous autobiographical manifesto by Hitler and definitely isn&amp;#8217;t one that should be putting a smile on anyone&amp;#8217;s face.

From someone almost choking to death via someone's pallu, washing laptops with detergent, waking up from coma to make green tea, to making hue and cry over there not being ketchup with pizza, TV soaps have given us cultural reset moments that can only be classified as magical realism of some sort. For example, a scene from 'Ishq Ki Dastaan Naagmani' that airs on Dangal TV shows Shankar falling off a terrace, cartwheeling through air. Paro follows him, gliding through air with a Superman-style gesture before she latches onto… a kite. Which is bigger than her in size. She clings onto the kite while Shankar grabs hold of her free hand. People from the terrace look on in horror as dramatic music plays et cetera. Somewhere in the midst of it all, the backdrop changes suddenly into a forest (?), over which the entire incident unfolds.Read all the Latest Buzz News here","પાકિસ્તાની ટીવી ડ્રામા 'બેપનાહ' એ સોશિયલ મીડિયા પર એક હલચલ મચાવી છે કારણ કે તેમાં મુખ્ય પાત્રને એડોલ્ફ હિટલરની 'માઇન કેમ્ફ' ની નકલ વાંચતા દર્શાવવામાં આવે છે. ટ્વિટર વપરાશકર્તાઓએ આ પુસ્તકને જોયું અને તેમની આશ્ચર્ય વ્યક્ત કરી, કારણ કે આ આત્મકથા તેના જાતિવાદી અને યહૂદીવિરોધી સામગ્રી માટે કુખ્યાત છે. જ્યારે દૃશ્ય પોતે ખુશીનો ક્ષણ નથી, દર્શકોએ નોંધ્યું કે અભિનેતા પુસ્તક વાંચતી વખતે સ્મિત કરતો હતો. આ ઘટના ટીવી સોપ્સના વિચિત્ર અને કલ્પિત પળોની યાદીમાં ઉમેરાય છે, જેમાં ભારતીય ડ્રામા પણ તેમની ઓવર-ધ-ટોપ અને અજ્ઞાનાત્મક પ્લોટ્સ માટે જાણીતા છે."
gujarati_test_160,"So the thing is done. And surprisingly for Pakistan, entirely by democratic norms, at least on the surface. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, however, had little flexibility in selecting a new army chief. His brother Nawaz, who runs the whole show, would have advised him to go by the book in selecting the new army chief. And that's what he did. Lt Gen Asim Munir, is the new Chief, and he is the senior most. But nothing in Pakistan is ever simple, particularly when it comes to the army's handling of the civilians, or vice versa. It's not at all simple for the new chief either. Bajwa's legacy is anything but mild.THE CHAOS DURING SELECTION First, the selection itself. According to Article 243(3) of the Constitution, the president appoints the services chiefs on the recommendation of the prime minister. Then there's the Rules of Business which also include the consultation clause. As in most countries, a list of those who are senior most are sent to the Defence Ministry, which then is supposed to forward this to the PMO. But the role of the Ministry came to the fore when the Defence Minister announced in a tweet that no summary had been sent to the PMO, even as the DG, Interservices Public Relations (ISPR) announced that it had done so. Matters were made worse as Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that the statement 'attributed' to Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif regarding a summary for appointing a new army chief was false.Finally, it was a period of tension while the President was 'consulted'. Even as the Information Minister announced that Lt Gen Asim Munir had been named chief of army staff and Lt Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the President was off to meet Imran Khan (apparently) recuperating from the assassination attempt. On the sidelines, the Defence Minister was still warning that it was a &amp;#8216;test&amp;#8217; for the President whether he would follow constitutional norms. In the end, he did, but not before Imran Khan made it abundantly clear that he had a voice not only in the selection, but the 'constitutional' process.That's important, as he - and his several thousands of supporters - see him as coming back to power.THE GENERALS TAKE A BOWLt-Gen Asim Munir's promotion makes it possible for him to continue for at least another four years, as now allowed under the new legislation, ironically made by the Imran Khan government. That gives him a comfortable tenure. Both are Bajwa loyalists, and the Dawn provides details about each.The most touted aspect of Lt Gen Munir is that he was the shortest serving ISI Chief, being pushed out by Khan, who seems to have favoured Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. Analysts say that this change was due to Gen Munir's demand that Khan's wife's financial assets be declared. The good Pirni was finally registered as a tax payer only in March 1, 2022, but seems to have had a lot put by, and made even more while her husband lorded over the PMO. Whether this version of events is true is unclear, as it seems unlikely that the COAS would tamely agree to change his ISI chief on the whims of a political head.Whatever the reason, Munir was shunted out in eight months, to command the Gujranwala Corps, a position he held for two years, before being moved to the GHQ as Quartermaster General. That's not exactly big stuff, of the kind Lt Gen Faiz Hameed can boast of. But he was part of the delegation which not only held talks with the Chinese last year, but was also part of the Quadrilateral Coordination Group (QCG), involving Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and the United States. In other words, he knows his China.THE TIME IS RATHER MORE THAN RIPEBoth step into a Pakistan that may seem changed out of recognition. Not the political noise and protests, which is par for the course here, but the attitude to the army, and probably the army itself. The hate against the Army Chief primarily, and less so the khakis was apparent in the shouts of 'kutta' against the army chief, while Khan himself not just targeted Bajwa, but tried to sow dissension against him within the army. That he may have succeeded was indicated in a rarest of rare presser where ISI Chief Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum gave a spirited defence of the Chief.But the trouble is that no one believes them anymore. That loss of faith in the army could only have gotten worse after the &amp;#8216;leaks&amp;#8217; of the General's declared income, which includes half a million dollars that his wife has in the US Banks and immense wealth to this immediate family, including plots in the elite Defence Housing Colony 'granted' to a new daughter-in-law. That's staggering, and makes allegations of Khan's Rs 142 million in Toshakhana gifts seem pale by comparison. These are declared assets.What the General holds in undeclared riches is anyone's guess. In short, the absolute trust and faith in the army is a thing of the past. At a time of severe economic stress and political bickering, the people's anger has fallen - rightly or wrongly - on the army. That means the new establishment could already have one hand tied behind its back.THAT POISONOUS LEGACY CONTINUESNot that it recognises this. The fact that one of its first acts was the re-arrest of PTI Senator Azam Swati for insulting the army on Twitter seems to indicate that the Bajwa 'show' will go on. How that show evolved is worth paraphrasing.General Bajwa himself inherited a none too great legacy, after a vilifying social media campaign was launched against him, just before he was to take over as the Chief, at a time when the outgoing chief Gen. Raheel Sharif was hoping for an extension. That extension could hardly have been desired to 'serve' his people. Clearly the rewards were magnificent. Then came a series of incidents that served to show just how far the army would go to keep its power - the extreme right wing clearly establishment backed the Tehreek-e-Labbaik protests against Nawaz Sharif, the later full use of the 'Panama leaks' to publicly name and shame the whole Sharif and Bhutto family, none of which were finally proven, and the blatant backing of Khan.The latter responded with this constant declarations that both were 'on the same page' on every issue. Under Bajwa in particular, the so-called 'hybrid' model was virtually out of the window, as the army took over almost every task of the government, heading even the prestigious China Pakistan Economic Corridor.  In simple words, the army, till it fell out with Khan, was not just on the same page, but had bought the entire book.The new army chief will therefore have to deal with a far more politicised and corrupt army - indeed the one arises from the other &amp;#8212; that could mean serious rot within. Remember, an attempted coup was planned as recently as 2014.It could happen again, if one group within the army decides to support Khan.NO OPTION TO WITHDRAWThe most delicious irony is that having brought matters to this pass, there is little chance that the new chief could suddenly decide to hold himself aloof from the political chaos, and restore the army's badly tattered dignity. But it's the very chaos, both political and economic, that will force him to intervene and hold the tiller steady (or unsteady, depending on your point of view), since a squabbling coalition clearly seems unable to do so.International agencies have warned of a currency crisis in Pakistan, as the rupee slid to below PKR 233 to the dollar. Debt and liabilities stood at Rs 62.46 trillion, about Rs 10 trillion more than the last fiscal year. Many countries have a high debt. The problem is the ability to repay it. This could inevitably put pressure on the defence budget.Remember, it was the army chief who stepped in to negotiate an immediate $1.2 bn from the IMF to stave off a crisis, and a crucial visit to the US just before delisting by the Financial Action Task Force; it was also the army which has been critical in trying to negotiate better terms with the Chinese. No, the chief can't step back. His choice is how much to step forward in ensuring that Khan doesn't make it to the elections.  FOR INDIA, IT'S ABOUT THE FACTS ON THE GROUNDFor India, the fundamental rule of distrusting Pakistan can hardly change. Remember the &amp;#8216;Bajwa doctrine&amp;#8217; in 2018 espoused peace with all neighbours, assuring Afghanistan that its sovereignty would be respected. That persuaded President Ghani to protest only marginally when Islamabad created a high-tech triple wire fence that guarded its weakest areas. Once nearly completed, Pakistan launched the Taliban. So much for Pakistani 'good intentions'.True, that fence is now under serious attack by an irritated Taliban. To the west, Pakistan's border with India remains largely peaceful due to the continued ceasefire, but that could change too. What is not going to change anytime soon is that Pakistan cannot afford a war, even if it receives assistance from friends like Turkey and China. This 'external balancing' can only work up to a point. Finally a country has to budget and create its own defences. It is likely that in this state of affairs, the army could work up an 'India threat' to shore up its rock bottom reputation. Statements from Indian army senior officers on retaking Pakistan Occupied Kashmir will help greatly in such efforts. Delhi could ideally leave Pakistan to its own devices and squabbling. But this time around, Pakistan is dangerously unstable, with repercussions for the rest of the region.  India must consider reaching out to the new chief, accepting - as everyone else does - that he will remain the engagement point for the foreseeable future, and suggest that a Pakistan that becomes a South Asian highway for trade and investment is the only way out for its own survival.It is also worth stressing that Delhi has other options, and can choose to ignore Islamabad entirely, as other forums beckon. Pakistan's only other option is to become a Chinese colony. Really, it doesn't need much heavy thinking.

gujarati_test_163,"Karnataka may be facing a shortfall in rains in July when compared to the same timeline last year, but the scientists at the India Meteorological Department are optimistic and predicted widespread rainfall across the state in the next 72 hours.'This will bring down the deficit, which is presently at minus 18 percent,' said A Prasad from IMD, Bengaluru.Prasad predicted that areas, including Bidar, Belagavi, Kalaburagi, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu and Shivamogga districts are likely to see moderate to heavy showers in the coming week. He also predicted slightly above normal rainfall over coastal Karnataka, Ghat districts and North Interior Karnataka.But the Cauvery river basin is facing a severe rain deficit, especially in the Kodagu district that has received very less rainfall. The Cauvery originates from Talacauvery in Kodgau district. 'The deficit has drastically come down. If you see the situation, where the deficit was 65 to 70 percent for Karnataka as a whole; and you see it as of today, the current deficit is of minus 18 percent, which means that Karnataka has received around 70 percent,' he said.Kodagu contributes to the Cauvery basin, but the shortfall has been a cause for concern. 'Kodagu has not been receiving rainfall. It is the origin of the Cauvery river and has recorded rainfall that has fallen short by minus 55,' said the IMD scientist.According to the MeT, coastal Karnataka has a deficit of minus 12; north interior Karnataka is minus 7; and south interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru, Chikkamagaluru, Kodagu, Mandya, Mysuru among others, has a deficit of minus 29.Cauvery water: To send, or not to sendTamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin has written to union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat seeking immediate intervention, as he alleged that the Karnataka government had not been releasing the southernmost state's share of Cauvery water despite intervention from the Cauvery Water Management Authority.'In this critical scenario, the standing kuruvai (short-term paddy) crop can be saved only if Karnataka releases water immediately,' Stalin said in his letter.State experts, however, said the rain and water deficit have also forced Karnataka to say that it will not be able to release water from the Cauvery to the neighbouring state. Karnataka is waiting for better rains before releasing the river water, said Karnataka agriculture minister N Cheluvarayaswamy.According to the final directive of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) and the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government is required to release 177.25 TMC of water to Tamil Nadu annually. But Karnataka is arguing that when it is already facing a major deficit of minus 21 this year, how will it be able to release the required quantity?Tamil Nadu, in return, argued that Karnataka has released less amount of water instead of the prescribed quantity but the Karnataka government countered that by saying in times of excess rains, the state has released more than the prescribed quantity.Last year, in the previous BJP regime, water resources minister Govind Karjol had said in a reply to a question raised by MLC Dinesh Gooligowda on water released to Tamil Nadu from the Cauvery: 'In the four months between June to September, Karnataka has released 416.65 TMC to TN as against the allocation by the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal of 177.25 TMC of water to the riparian state.'Karjol also said, as per the CWDT directive, Tamil Nadu is eligible for 101.08 TMC of water in the months between June and September, but four times more was released due to excess rainfall in 2022. A senior officer from the water resources department also said if excess water was not released from the swelling Cauvery basin, then dams in Karnataka would have burst or been breached.Cheluvarayaswamy said if the rains, as predicted by the MeT, do not happen, the state government will have to declare affected districts as drought-hit and also try to introduce cloud seeding to improve the situation. In the background of this situation, water experts said agencies in Bengaluru and other cities must stress on rainwater harvesting and ensure that this kind of 'dry state' does not occur.Low water levels in major reservoirsDepleting levels of various dams and water reservoirs in Karnataka is also a cause for concern. The levels were already low ahead of the monsoon but with the state staring at a rain deficit, the situation does not seem to improve anytime soon.21.07.2023 ರಂತೆ ಪ್ರಮುಖ ಜಲಾಶಯದ ಮಟ್ಟ. Reservoir Level as of 21.07.2023. pic.twitter.com/izKcyHbQFA&amp;mdash; Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (@KarnatakaSNDMC) July 21, 2023For example, for the Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir, which is a lifeline for farmers in Mysuru and Mandya districts, the water level is at 90.1 feet and at 33 percent of its storage capacity as on July 21. The reservoir had almost reached its full depth and storage capacity of 124.8 feet and 49.45 TMC, respectively, this time last year. In May, its depth had fallen to 83.6 feet; if this drops below 74 feet, the water will not be released for irrigation but saved as drinking water.The rain prediction in the next 24 hours for south interior Karnataka, where the water reservoir is located, does not look as promising with a forecast of very light to light rains.Another major reservoir, Tungabhadra at Vijayanagara district, is at 13 percent of its storage capacity (105.79 TMC). While Harangi (in rain-starved Kodagu) and Kabini (Mysuru district) reservoirs are at 73 and 67 percent of their total capacity, the Hemavathi dam in Hassan district is at 48 percent.According to data from the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), the state has a gross storage capacity of 895.20 TMC if 14 major water reservoirs are taken into account. As on July 21, the capacity of 11 reservoirs stand below 50 percent. The water stands at 31 percent (277.73 TMC) of the total storage capacity of all 14 major reservoirs; this capacity stood at 73.5 percent (655.88 TMC) this time last year.IMD predicts heavy rains over coastal KarnatakaThe IMD on Friday predicted light rains in Bengaluru with heavy rains over coastal Karnataka districts in the next 24 hours.

gujarati_test_164,"Union home minister Amit Shah in an exclusive interview with Rahul Joshi, Group Editor-in-Chief, Network18, has said the biggest achievement of the BJP under the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is that the criminalisation of politics and politicisation of administration, which had earlier existed, have been replaced with the politics of performance. 'The one who performs will be elected by the public,' Shah said.On the recent hijab controversy, which started in Karnataka, the home minister said it was his 'personal belief' that dress code should be followed in schools irrespective of religion. He also said the judgment is awaited, and whatever the court decides will be accepted by him, and should be welcomed by the people across all sections of society.Translated and edited excerpts:There are very few politicians who understand Uttar Pradesh as well as you. BJP won 2014, 2017 elections because of your groundwork in UP. This time you have said that we will win 300 seats. Now that three phases of election on 172 seats has passed, what is your assessment?Three phases have gone by, others remain. I have carried out Jan Vishwas Yatras and Vijay Sankalp Yatras in every district of UP. I have done rallies in every district of the state. In Uttar Pradesh, the BJP will win with a full majority. Under the leadership of Yogi Adityanath, the BJP has been successful in winning the hearts of the people. Support and love for the Prime Minister is much higher today than it was in December 2013. This the feeling on the ground. I know that the BJP will win with a majority in these elections. We will seal the election by hitting a boundary.If you look at surveys, the BJP is getting 230-260 seats in this election. In 2017, the prediction was 238 seats, we won 325 seats. Perception is an important aspect in a survey, because people link their credibility with the surveys. Also, what the public tells the person who is doing the survey may not even be true. There are many contradictions.Home Minister, you have done a lot of rallies in this election. What are the big issues with which you have gone to the public? There are four big issues with which the people of UP have supported and strengthened us more than in the previous three elections. First is law and order. Second, 'gareeb kalyan'. Third has been development - including access to drinking water and electricity. The fourth issue is the way we have improved the administration of Uttar Pradesh. These are the main issues and each one is very important. SP and BSP governments that worked on caste lines and dynasty never listened to the voice of the people. One government came… worked for one caste, another government worked for another caste. People had lost hope of ever getting justice. People had resigned themselves to this. But after the change came with Modi ji in 2014, people started seeing hope in us and we have lived up to it.So one of the main issues is law and order?I have travelled by road to every district and block in UP, from May 2013 to date. Besides some blocks of Sonbhadra, I have gone to every block. I can tell you that getting an FIR registered in UP was a big deal at one time. When the SP came to power, people of one community thought they had been given the power to do as they pleased. In West UP, buffaloes were taken from people's homes and the farmers couldn't do anything. I have actually seen that situation. Many people shifted from Meerut to Delhi so that their children could study. People were migrating from Meerut. Gangsters used to capture lands of residents worth crores.After Yogi ji came into power, dacoity came down 72%. Loot came down 62%. Kidnapping came down 39%. Rape has come down 50%. This is a very important issue in Uttar Pradesh. This is the only time that Azam Khan, Atiq Ansari and Mukhtar Ansari are in jail. The people of Uttar Pradesh couldn't imagine at one time that people who used to harass them would be in jail. Today, people live in peace. There is no 'bahubali' and mafia in any district, something that was a permanent feature earlier. Property worth Rs 200 crore that had been grabbed by gangsters has now been confiscated from them. This is a huge achievement and people are acknowledging our work. In Kanpur, I have seen girls out on the roads on scooties in the middle of the night, and I'm so happy for them. I saw this for myself from my hotel window. This is a huge achievement and people are acknowledging our work. And it is translating into votes.The law and order issue is important. And now PM Modi has also spoken on terrorism. He spoke in Hardoi on the Ahmedabad blast case in which 38 accused have been sentenced to death. He said these terrorists were freed from jail during the SP regime.Eleven such instances took place during the SP and BSP eras, when Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) cases were withdrawn. What do SP and BSP have to say about security in the country? They will have to answer the public. After withdrawing UAPA and POTA who are they helping? And why? For their vote banks? Do other people do not have the right to vote? Those who are the victims don't have a vote? This is the feeling in the whole of Uttar Pradesh.There are many such instances of this during Congress regimes too all over the country. Because Narendra Modi was Chief Minister (of Gujarat) at the time, this case could be resolved. There are many blast cases you can analyse. In very few, people have got justice or a judgment has even come. Police worked efficiently and came out with evidence that convinced the court. The court also appreciated the evidence it received and passed judgment. The behaviour of SP, BSP and other parties is clearly visible.When you talk about appeasement, you are talking about Muslims and Yadavs. Yogi Adityanath has said this election is about 80-20. So do you see this election as Muslims Vs Hindus?I don't think this election is about Muslims or Yadavs or Hindus. Yogi ji may have spoken about vote percentages but not about Muslims Vs Hindus.Don't you think that the election is being polarized?Yes, polarisation is happening. The poor and farmers are being polarised. Many farmers are getting money from the Kisan Kalyan Nidhi Yojana. I can see 'polarisation' clearly.So you don't see Hindu-Muslim polarisation?See, the voting pattern can't be termed polarization. We have left no stone unturned. We have extended benefits to every section of society, irrespective of caste and religion. Whoever was eligible has received benefits. Under the PM's initiative, we have given gas to 1.66 crore women in UP. 2.62 lakh families did not have proper toilets. Can you imagine that? Today, women don't have to defecate in the open and they are happy. 40 lakh women have benefitted from the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana. In 1.41 crore houses there was no bulb or electricity for the last 70 years. Electricity has now reached every single village in UP, thanks to PM Modi. About 2.70 crore LED bulbs were distributed. 15 crore people in UP are getting free rations under the Gareeb Kalyan Anna Yojana. To this, Yogi ji added dal, edible oil and salt for the poor. Under this government, 42 lakh people have received homes.In our Sankalp Patra, we have said there will be no one in UP without a home by 2024. 8.80 lakh street vendors in UP have got loans under the Swarn Nidhi Yojana. Schemes made by Modi ji for the poor were for every man in the entire country. Yogi ji has enabled these schemes to reach the poor man in every part of UP.You were telling me that the kind of work Yogi Adityanath has done in Uttar Pradesh is much better than other states?It's very good.I want to ask you a question related to this; I had asked Yogi Adityanath the same question - the party that talks of 'sabka sath sabka vikaas', it's PM Modi's anthem, yours and CM Yogi's too - when it comes to distribution of tickets, why does it not give tickets to Muslims? What is the Bharatiya Janata Party's relationship with Muslims?When it comes to BJP's relationship with Muslims, it's the same relation the government has with an Indian citizen and the responsible member of the political group (Rajnaitik Dal). But we also have to see who gives votes in elections.So, you are saying that this is a political need?It's not a need. It's political conduct.So it's necessary to win elections, which is why it's done?Absolutely. But after that if there is any discrimination in their progress or development then someone can blame us. The government works on the principles of the Constitution. And the government gets elected by people's votes, the ones who give them the votes. Political representation is linked to this.Do you think exodus is still a big issue in Muzaffarnagar and Kairana?It's still an issue, but the fact is those who have come are now living in peace. And they don't have to leave.So the situation has changed a lot?Yes, it has changed. See, the biggest achievement of the BJP under Yogi Adityanath is that, in Uttar Pradesh, the politics had been influenced by crime and the administration had become politicised but after the BJP came to power, and after Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister, neither the politics is under a criminal influence, nor the administration is politicised. Both these things, which were detrimental to the progress of the people and state, we have been successful in removing. After the elevation of Narendra Modi to national politics, 'parivaarvadi' (dynasty politics), 'jativaadi' (casteism) aur 'tushtikaranvaadi' (appeasement) politics has ended and has been replaced by the politics of performance. The one who will perform, will be elected by the public.I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, after 15 years of rule of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, UP was ranked 8th or 9th in the economic performance among the states. It (UP) has a 22 crore population with highest area and yet its economic performance was on that scale. If you just count the consumption of 22 crore people, your economy should be at number 1 position. In just five years, we were able to get Uttar Pradesh's rank from the 8th-9th position to the number 2 in India. And within just two years, after the BJP gets elected, we will get UP to number 1 position.This is a big achievement. UP's GDP was Rs10,90,000 crore, now it's Rs 21,31,000 crore. In just a period of five years, we have doubled it. The state was 14th in Ease of Doing Business, now we are at the number 2 position. Unemployment was at 17.3%, now it's at 4.1%. And around 1.61 crore job opportunities have been created. It's a big achievement.Akhilesh Yadav says the BJP is avoiding the real issues. It talks of appeasement, when it should talk of price rise and unemployment.Akhilesh ji should talk in terms of data, whether we are avoiding the real issues or if he is. The whole world has witnessed rise in prices after Covid-19, to an extent, it's here (in India too). However, Modi ji has controlled it to a great extent. It's a temporary phase. In the 7.5 years of Modi sarkaar, we have controlled inflation for six years. After Covid-19, the global market scenario has been affected. Whatever is imported has a high price, and that is reflected in domestic prices. It's a temporary phase.Another issue in these elections has come from Karnataka &amp;#8212; the Hijab row. Do you think this issue of Hijab is justified for Muslim women and girls? Do you think religious rights should be given due importance in institutions, or can they override these? It is my personal belief that people of all religions should accept the school's dress code. And the issue is now in court, and the court is conducting its hearings on the matter, and whatever it decides should be followed by all. Ultimately, it has to be decided whether the country will function on the constitution or whims. My personal belief only remains until the court makes a decision, and once the court makes a decision, then I should accept it, and everyone should accept it. But I still personally believe that every student should function according to the dress code and uniform mandated by the school.But do you think there a conspiracy at hand in this issue? The Campus Front of India is active in its involvement.These people may have their active involvement, but I'll just say that their intentions will not come to fruition. The people of India will accept the court's judgment once it comes.I would like to talk more on UP elections. When you campaigned for the party in the first three phases of polls, then you tried to influence Jayant Chaudhary a lot, saying that he was a good man in a wrong alliance. Would you stand by your statement even today?Do you have any recording of this statement?Have you not said this, then what did you say on this issue?I'm not saying that I have not said it. The media should not pick things out of the wind. The elections have been packed, the BJP will come to power with full majority. I had only said he had 'gone to the wrong place'.Any possibility of a post-poll alliance with him?I have not said anything on the matter. That question does not arise. Our party will come to power with a big margin, with full majority, then what is the need of a post-poll alliance? We already have a pre-poll alliance with two parties. And it is our tradition that even if we obtain majority we make our government under the NDA alliance. And we will not need anyone, we will win with full majority.Some people who left you, three ministers and some MLAs, have tried to give another colour to the elections. They said these polls are not of 80 vs 20 but 85 vs 15; backward vs forward.All the voters are important in the elections. But I admit that an image was being created that there is fragmentation in the backward communities. I have roamed the state in the past three phases, I can tell you that Modi ji's Gareeb Kalyan schemes have changed the entire picture of the elections.So are you saying that apart from law and order, this is a big issue in these elections?Both these issues are big. The scale of our beneficiaries is of utmost importance to change these elections. And it's very clearly visible, for 70 years in my home, no one increased their services, but Modiji gave us a card of Rs 5 lakh, through which, expenses worth Rs 5 lakh, our health bill, the Indian government is now paying. It's a very big thing.So you are saying these elections can rise beyond religion and caste?It is already beyond such issues.Then why is there so much talk of religion and caste? There is religion and caste in every speech.There is a tradition that was started by the Congress, which the SP and BSP have cemented, and were successful on these fronts in the past too. But I think now, it's slowly decreasing.Taking a look at data, in the last elections, the BJP got more than 40% votes, and the SP and BSP had a vote share of about 22%. If you look at the trend now, Muslim votes seem to be polarised, and it seems that it will be consolidated with the Samajwadi party, and they have Yadavs too, and some other castes are joining them. There's Rajbhars, and even some Jats may be influenced. If you look at this entire scenario, do you see the picture changing?I feel every election is different and every elections' dynamics are different too, counting is different too. However, to look at what you're saying, look at the 2017 and 2019 elections, all three to four parties were together. What happened? We won 35 seats, and we were victorious with 287 in terms of assembly. Thirty-five were Lok Sabha seats, but if we put it in the structure of assembly, then we won in 287 assemblies. If you give the example of 2017, then there were only two parties; Congress and SP. In 2019, SP, BSP, Congress and RLD, all four had combined, we won in 287 assembly seats, and 35 in Lok Sabha. Politics does not work like this, one plus one is not always two, it can become 11 too.But they say state elections are fought in a different way than the Centre's, and that you cannot win by consolidating castes like this.No. See in 2014, 2017, 2019 elections, Uttar Pradesh's public had affirmed Narendra Modi's leadership. And I am confident that even this year things will go the same way. The same way Modi ji has worked, even what Yogi ji has done, will become a big capital for us.How do you view Mayawati in these elections? She is not being heard or seen too much and does not have a very high profile campaign.The BSP has maintained its relevancy. I believe they will get votes. I don't know how much it will convert into seats but it will get votes.So the Jatav vote bank will stick by them. Is there any other group that will support them?Muslims will also support them, in a lot of seats.So, will you get any benefit from this because SP and BSP are against each other?Benefit and loss do not happen like this, it is seat specific. It cannot be measured like this. But it is not correct to assume that BSP's relevance has decreased.Is there any possibility of a BJP alliance with Mayawati?But there is no need of an alliance, we will come to power with full majority. Support is needed of all parties later to do good work, even SP's is needed. Opposition's creative support is always needed. But there is no need for alliance with anyone to form a government. The alliance we have is good, and we will form a government.Do you think this is the fight for backward votes… for non-Jatav backward votes?See, UP has three sections. First is poor; our schemes were aimed at the development of poor sections. Second is the middle-class people who are with the BJP because of law and order, and peaceful life. Third is those who are financially successful and are linked with us to develop the state industrially and otherwise. We have waived loans of about 86 lakh farmers worth Rs 35,000 crore. We have purchased almost 435 lakh metric tonne fertiliser and Rs 80,000 crore has been directly transferred to farmers for that. Around 2.84 crore farmers have been benefitted under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, with Rs 6,000 transferred to them every year; Rs 32,500 crore have been transferred till now. Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Fasal Bima Yojana, 25,60,000 farmers have been compensated for Rs 2,200 crore till now. Rs 4.72 lakh has been transferred on a short-term basis for every crop. Almost two crore farmers have received the Kisan credit card. And what has been the change due to this - UP has become number 1 in sugarcane, sugar, wheat, potato, green peas, mango, amla and milk.Now Akhilesh ji is saying we are deviating from the real issues we are not. Why was not the state number 1 in sugarcane, milk, wheat production? Because you did not perform. And we helped in farmers' development and also compensated farmers for their work.Is there no anger in farmer due to recent agitation?There was an attempt to create a perception but they were not successful.There is a big attempt to influence the Brahmin vote bank, especially by Akhilesh Yadav. He has said he will also celebrate Parshuram Jayanti, what do you have to say about this?I would call this deviation from issues. To indulge is caste politics is to deviate, right? We are talking of the poor, of rural voters, of urban voters, of middle-class voters. We are not talking of caste.How important do you think is the Owaisi factor in this election? He created a dent (in Muslim vote bank) in the Bihar election… There was firing at his cavalcade too!Owaisi ji travels across the country. He mainly addresses the minority and he gets votes.He got in Bihar, but not in West Bengal…It is not possible in every election, but he is the centre of attraction among a section of youth…His entourage was attacked…Yes.Even though your law and order situation there is good…An isolated incident can't be linked to the law and order situation. It becomes a law and order situation if no action is taken after the attack on Owaisi. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government arrested two accused within two hours. We held a security assessment meeting within three hours. Within eight hours, we took a call and offered him Z security. He refused, which is another thing, but we left no stone unturned.Yogi Adityanath says Owaisi should be careful about statements like 'How long will Modi and Yogi remain in power? Once they retire, it will be on us…'It is an individual opinion, but I think every person should have security. And we offered him Z security.You think Muslim youth are attracted to Owaisi in UP?Of course, he is a centre of attraction among Muslim youth.So you think he can eat into the Muslim vote share?We will know that only after the ballot boxes are opened.How do you see Congress in this election? Priyanka Gandhi spoke about reservation for women. The party started a campaign 'Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon'. Their vote share was 6%?An election took place in recent past in a major state like West Bengal. They won zero seats.Are you saying they will win zero seats in UP?I am not saying. This just indicates their future.Punjab CM from Congress Charanjit Singh Channi recently said, in the presence of Priyanka Gandhi, he would not allow any 'Bhaiyya' to form a government in the state. What is your comment on this?This is the style of the Congress party. They give different statements in different places. I don't think this statement is okay for a healthy society. India is a nation. Whoever wants to go to Gujarat, UP or Punjab to earn their livelihood or career can go. I don't support this kind of statement or politics for votes. Priyanka Gandhi was expressing her approval on this statement on the stage. In two days, in UP, she said the party is fighting for the pride of UP. I have never seen such a contradiction within two days.You often mention Balakot, saying PM Modi fought the enemy fiercely. But Rahul Gandhi has said Pakistan and China have come together because of the government.Rahul Gandhi doesn't know the history of this country. He doesn't know what happened in 1962 and whose mistake it was. The Narendra Modi government has given a strong reply to every challenge posed by China, be it Galwan or Uri. The Modi government has protected the borders and sovereignty of the country. I don't think this kind of statements about neighbouring countries should be made by any national leader. I want to ask him that 'you are saying all this in Parliament, but you break all protocols to meet a Chinese delegation. What did you discuss with them?' Such statements show there is a dearth of serious politicians.You praise Yogi Adityanath. He is the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and the face of your party in UP. If you win with majority, will he be the CM?Of course, we have fought the elections under his leadership, so he will be the CM.If you get a majority?There is no question of majority, we will win with a huge majority. He is the face no matter what.I want to shift the focus away from UP and want to ask questions about CAA……Before that, let me elaborate on the education system in UP. The state has a majority of youth. The education system had become miserable. After coming to power, the BJP government opened 10 international universities, 51 new colleges and new buildings for 80 colleges. First, there were 12 medical colleges, now there are 40. First, there were 1,900 medical seats, which are now up to 4,200. We have opened 28 engineering colleges, 26 polytechnic colleges, 751 Kasturba Vidyalaya for girls. We have brought about a change in perspective on education, be it medical, engineering, professional or traditional courses. The whole atmosphere related to education has changed. Youngsters are hopeful now because of this. The youth are seeing, say something like Ken-Betwa, people have been hearing about it for years, but the Modi government allotted Rs 44,000 crore. They have seen infrastructural changes. UP got five expressways, eight international airports, taking the total to 12, and widening or strengthening of 70,000 km of roadways. At least 7,000 km of roads in rural areas have been fixed.Akhilesh Yadav says the expressways were being made in their tenure, the BJP is taking credit for it.Ask him to show the map of any of the expressway, barring one. We are also planning to connect all roads. The change in infrastructure and education have made youngsters hopeful and confident. The youth of UP want to bring about a change and if they take part in the growth, it will be a blessing for the entire country.Punjab has voted. What do you have to say about the fight the BJP put up with Captain Amarinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa?Except for fortunetellers, nobody can predict what will happen in Punjab. It was a different type of election. We are positive that we put forth a strong challenge.You may have to bear the brunt of farmers' agitation. Anyway, you have never fought on many seats there because of Akali Dal.I held nine rallies in Punjab. Security is also a major issue there. It is a border state. The breach of PM Modi's security, where he was stopped from addressing a rally, was also a major issue. We will get success there, the extent we will know once the results are out.Surveys are predicting AAP and Congress are ahead.I still maintain no survey can predict the poll result in Punjab.What will happen if there is a hung assembly?It depends on numbers. There can be a coalition government of two-three parties, like there have been in this country.CM Channi recently wrote to a letter you, to which you replied a couple of days ago. Does your government think there any link between the separatists and the AAP or Arvind Kejriwal?Forget about Aam Aadmi Party or Arvind Kejriwal, any party's link to a separatist or terrorist group and its use for political gain in elections is a serious issue. No government will take it lightly, nor can we. We will investigate it.Do you think such a thing was happening… since you replied to the letter? If the chief minister of an elected government writes to you, you can't take it lightly. We will know the facts only after the investigation.Is it a tough fight in Uttarakhand? Congress is saying they will form a government there.We will definitely form a government in Uttarakhand. Dhami ji (Pushkar Dhami) has brought about tremendous growth in a very small span of time. In the past five years, Char Dham and mega electricity projects have been taken up. The state government has worked for the poor.The state saw three CMs in five years. Some major leaders defected to the Congress. Will it have an impact?Such things do have an impact. But a sizeable positive vote bank has been created there.Are you sure you will win with a clear majority?Yes, we are confident of a clear majority.How do you see the Goa elections?In Goa, our performance has been good. We will improve our numbers from the last time.Last time, you formed a government despite low numbers.The numbers were not so low. They will improve this time. We will form a government in Goa. …In Manipur, too, our leaders are fighting well. In five years, the state didn't see a single blockade, terrorist activity, too, is under control. For the first time, those from the hilly areas are saying if there is any government that has brought about development it is the BJP. The Biren Singh government has brought about development. People from the hilly region will support us.When will the Citizenship (Amendment) Act be implemented?As long as we are not free from Covid, this can't be a priority. Since CAA was passed, three Covid waves have hit us in the past two years. Thankfully, things are getting better, the third wave is receding. The decision is linked to the Covid situation. But there is no question of going back on it. That question simply does not arise.This Uttarakhand election saw the issue of Uniform Civil Code crop up. Will your government take it forward?The Uttarakhand CM has included it in his manifesto for the next term. He held a press conference to announce it. I believe, it will come into effect in Uttarakhand once our government comes to power.Will it be implemented in the rest of India?It needs comprehensive discussions. We will discuss it with all stakeholders.But is this a start?Yes.When can the people of Kashmir expect elections?The delimitation exercise is about to get over. After this, whatever will be the reasonable timeframe - about six-eight months - the elections will be held. There should be no confusion about that.Imran Khan recently said India and Pakistan should resolve their issues together, especially Kashmir.I am very clear about this - Kashmir is an integral part of India. There is no point of discussion here. It is a part of India, this is the position taken by all governments in our Parliament.

gujarati_test_166,"When I was a child, we used to live a few doors away from the home of this kid we called Piku. He was older than me, and a couple of grades ahead. In fact, I saw very little of him. Now, as a typical middle-class Indian kid, I would dread bringing home my report card thrice a year from school to show my parents. Do you see that your marks have gone down in this or that subject, they would ask. Okay, maybe you scored better than last time, but what about last year? You used to be more diligent. All you want to do these days is play cricket.And finally, what will you do when you are older and need to study even more? Do you know how many hours Piku-da studies every night? The answer to this question, supplied by my parents, would range anywhere from four hours to six hours and sometimes even an impossible nine hours. Nevertheless, I would shudder.Since we all went to the same school, I found out one day. Piku-da had failed the sixth grade. It turns out that my parents had made it all up. About Piku being a brilliant student and all. It had just been a tactic to keep me scared.Something very similar is happening between India and Sri Lanka right now. As India ships thousands of tons of food and fuel to keep the island nation afloat, we cannot help asking. Whatever happened to all those global indexes on which Sri Lanka was beating India hands down? And to the experts who made these indexes? I am afraid I cannot see them as ambitious, but ultimately unselfish parent-like figures who just want India to do better. More likely that these are grown-ups with specific interests in mind, and who respond to specific incentives.It seems that every other day, some 'global index' comes out, showing India's rank has gone down this or that number of places. We told you so, critics of PM Modi proclaim triumphantly. Whenever the government tries to defend itself, or question the methodology of these indexes, they are mocked. Don't run away from reality, they say. Don't you know that these indexes are prepared by experts? How dare you question them?The reality, however, is cargo ships crossing the straits near India's southern tip right now, loaded with lakhs of tons of urgent relief material for the people of Sri Lanka. You may or may not be someone who likes to stick it to common Indians by saying that 'Ram Setu' is a myth (while keeping silent on Jesus, for instance). But I assure you that the 2.7 lakh metric tons of diesel that India just sent to Sri Lanka are not a myth.As an Indian, I take no joy in the troubles of Sri Lanka. I am glad we are doing everything we can to help. My taunts are meant for the experts who came up with all those indexes looking down on the state of affairs in India. I remember the noted expert Kaushik Basu, a former chief economist with the World Bank, had shared a chart showing India's GDP contracting more than Sri Lanka (in 2020), and India also having more Covid deaths per capita. Portions of this data soon made it to Rahul Gandhi's social media timeline. Any updates on that?If the critics made the best of an outlier year that happened due to a once-in-a-century shock event, the various index makers were worse. What about the recent Global Happiness Index? India ranks 136th, while Sri Lanka is ranked higher at 129th. How? Will asking that question to the experts invite jibes of being uneducated, a 'bhakt' and a graduate of 'Whatsapp University'?India ranks 136th, while Sri Lanka is ranked higher at 129th. How? Will asking that question to the experts invite jibes of being uneducated, a 'bhakt' and a graduate of 'Whatsapp University'?What about the Global Hunger Index, which became the focus of such a media obsession in India? India is ranked 101, while Sri Lanka is leagues ahead of us at 65th. And yet, India is sending food aid to Sri Lanka. Because hunger is real, while hunger indexes are not. Did you know that President Biden has just warned Americans of food shortages? Meanwhile, India's granaries are so full that we are getting ready for bumper exports of wheat to countries around the world.What about the Global Hunger Index, which became the focus of such a media obsession in India? India is ranked 101, while Sri Lanka is leagues ahead of us at 65th. And yet, India is sending food aid to Sri Lanka. Because hunger is real, while hunger indexes are not.I know. It is time for the experts to make technical excuses. As usual, I forgot to read the fine print that says the experts don't actually take responsibility for anything. I forgot to read the part that says these are experts who excel at exercising their expertise. You may pay tribute to them, but you may not hold them accountable.Also Read: China Prefers Messed up Economies, but Sri Lanka's Mess is of Its Own MakingThen, there is the celebrated Human Development Index, or HDI. Again, Sri Lanka is miles ahead of us. We are ranked number 131, while they are at number 72! What happened there? Did you know that the Human Development Index is based upon the work of Amartya Sen? By the way, I am looking at you, Kerala. Don't let your liberal politicians fool you. Ask them to discuss jobs, wealth creation, investment and ease of doing business, not HDI.Who wants to read the Global Gender Gap report that places Sri Lanka some twenty places ahead of India? Or the Inequality Report, which places Sri Lanka over thirty places ahead? So let us see. Sri Lanka has more happiness, less hunger, better human development, less wealth inequality, and better gender equity than India. And yet…Again, this is not about picking on Sri Lanka. This is about asking questions to the experts. What is the real-world value of those indexes that you churn out day after day?Meanwhile, our intellectuals have already changed tack. Not long ago, Sri Lanka was better off than India was on these global indexes. And hence, a lesson to the Modi government on how to govern. Today, it is the opposite. The intellectuals insist that Sri Lanka is a majoritarian state, with economic policies that are exactly the same as that of the Modi government. So, either way, it is always a lesson for Modi!Also Read: Voice from Sri Lanka: The Sea of Protesters is Not Going Home Until Rajapaksa DoesBut then, perhaps the trouble is not with the intellectuals. It is with people who take them seriously. Why do we give so much importance to those with no skin in the game? In our national psyche, there is this image of the sage-like expert, detached from worldly pursuits, giving out knowledge to those who seek.But real-world experts are not like that, even the biggest ones. Are you worried about rising prices? Then meet Paul Krugman, public intellectual, professor, New York Times columnist, and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics. And most importantly, a supporter of the 'liberal' Biden regime. He says he has seen no evidence that inflation hurts the poor. In fact, he has a chart that shows that the more prices rise, the better for the poor! Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, my friend. We have a couple of Indian-origin folks on that list as well, right?But we respect the experts too much, we value the doers too little. Indeed, if there is a problem with India, it is that we have not developed enough of an anti-intellectual tradition. America was built by the pioneers, not its intellectuals. They invented the lightbulb and the airplane. They were entrepreneurs, hustlers, and robber barons. They built the railroads, the mines, the steel mills and the factories that won two world wars. They did all the good, bad and ugly things that made America the richest and most powerful nation on earth. The hand-wringing intellectuals came much later, and they gave us wokeness.So how do you make one of these indexes? Believe me, it is easy. Pick up some indicators, and assign some weights to them until you have something you can call your own formula. Play around with hundreds of indicators, and weights, till you have exactly the rankings you want. With the widespread availability of Excel software, this has never been easier.In fact, even that might be too much intellectual honesty for the experts. To have an index, you don't even need real-world data. You can survey other experts and create your own data. That is how many of these 'democracy indexes' and 'press freedom' indexes have come to be. 'Aapko kaisa lag raha hai,' call ten of your friends in India and ask. Or not, because you don't have to publish their names anyway. So take ten people who might not exist, ask for their opinions, plug in some fractions to create a 'formula' and generate rankings. Then you sit back and relax as the liberal ecosystem amplifies your 'findings.'Of course, I am exaggerating, but not by very much. There is in fact a famous global index for which they surveyed the opinions of 370 unnamed experts worldwide. And before you ask, India was ranked last in this list. Look it up.Oh, and what happens when India manages to do well on one of these indexes? The intellectuals throw a fit, and ask for a recount. This is what happened with the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index. As it turns out, the data had been manipulated after all. In favor of China, not India.As Sri Lanka struggles, and India helps, one wonders how the anti-India lobbies will demonise us over this. They have already labeled India as the real villain of the war in Ukraine, with India staying neutral and buying a tiny bit of Russian oil. The European countries, who have spent 35 billion Euros on Russian oil since the war began, and provided 1 billion Euros of aid to Ukraine, certainly agree.On the topic of Sri Lanka, the anti-India lobby has already made its opening moves. First, they accused both Sri Lanka and India of being majoritarian states with similar economic policies. Now, a major Indian newspaper has taken it one step further. They say that Indian aid is an effort to keep Rajapaksa in power against the wishes of his people. They slipped in this talking point very smoothly as well. They attribute it not to some expert, but an unnamed protester on the beaches of Sri Lanka. Yes, propaganda is truly a work of art. The day is not far when India will be accused of an imperialist plot to take over the small island. Watch this space.Abhishek Banerjee is an author and columnist. He tweets @AbhishBanerj.

gujarati_test_167,"As expected, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge again failed to prove his worth as the chief of the grand old party. Kharge couldn't show that he was in charge of the party during the plenary session, but his responsibilities grew a lot. The unwritten message is very clear: Kharge will neither have the authority to run the party as per his wish, nor any autonomy, but will always have to obey the wishes of the Gandhi family. The only difference is that earlier, as the president of the party was from the family, at the end of the day, the blame used to come to the Gandhis, but now they will not have to take any direct responsibility.More responsibilityFirst of all, at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, it was decided that no election for the committee would take place. This means that the status quo will be maintained. On one hand, this demonstrates that Kharge lacked the courage to assert his own authority in a minor party reform. On the other hand, the strength of the CWC increased from 25 to 35.Apart from the Gandhi family members and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge will have to nominate around 30 members. It was a well-scripted plan to show the public that Kharge has massive power over the party, but at the end of the day, the real power will be in the hands of the Gandhi family. Many people inside the Congress believe that Rahul Gandhi always wanted to change the status quo but took little initiative to do so. It would be interesting to see whether he stays in the CWC or not.The reality is that Kharge will have to accommodate people close to all three Gandhis, which means Sonia, Rahul, and Priyanka. After all these, he will have some seats for his own people and then one or two from other lobbies inside the Congress. At the end of the day, the CWC will again become a coterie of Gandhi family members.Failed opportunity to change status quoAfter 24 years, when the Congress elected Mallikarjun Kharge, a non-Gandhi, as its new president last year, the party workers and the general public had high expectations. They expected that things would change and that Kharge would make critical decisions for the party&amp;#8217;s future. From the Gujarat election to how he handled the Rajasthan crisis, Kharge had many chances to show the Gandhis that he was in charge. Yet, he remained largely silent on the major concerns. The plenary session was a one-of-a-kind chance for Kharge to show how powerful he really is.The last two Congress presidents who were not Gandhis — PV Narasimha Rao and Sitaram Kesri — opted to hold CWC elections. This session was a good moment for the Congress to have a leader who understands the priorities of accountable political discourse but is not afraid of taking decisions. Since more than two decades ago, the CWC has been home to a collection of individuals who have lost touch with grassroots politics. By acting as Gandhi&amp;#8217;s sycophant, this group ruined the Congress party. When these individuals were in charge, the party lost many state elections and performed poorly in national elections. Unfortunately, this status quo will continue.Nothing goes beyond Gandhis in CongressAt the session, there was a lot of disagreement in the party about whether or not elections would be held during this meeting, but there was no disagreement about securing permanent positions for the Gandhis at the CWC. Without a doubt, the Bharat Jodo Yatra was a fantastic event that enhanced employee morale. Sonia Gandhi&amp;#8217;s passion and work are likewise above reproach. In contrast, making Gandhi members permanent will simply serve to sustain the status quo.However, the Congress&amp;#8217; decision to have a 50 percent quota for youth, SC, ST, OBCs, and minorities at the CWC is a welcome amendment that was not previously present. Looking at the ground reality in Congress, these little changes will not make much of a difference. The Congress party needs to change, and that can only happen if strong steps are taken. Some decisive actions are disliked by most people, but if the intentions are good, these actions help the cause in the long run. The current situation will not allow Kharge to function autonomously because he will have to make room for people close to the Gandhis individually. The CWC election would have allowed the party to understand the real support of the people who have been holding the position at the highest decision-making body of the Congress.Strategic Bankruptcy of CongressDespite the highly publicised Bharat Jodo Yatra during the parliamentary session, the Congress did not alter its political strategy. Rahul Gandhi and others kept making personal attacks on Narendra Modi, which was the same strategy that had failed before. While it is an example of the strategic bankruptcy of Congress, there are several examples of the grand old party&amp;#8217;s dishonesty. In September last year, for instance, Rahul Gandhi stated that the Congress party would implement 'one person, one post.' But Kharge is the president of the party and also the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.Under the control of the Gandhis, the Congress will never undergo reform. It is crucial that Mallikarjun Kharge maintains the independence and integrity of the grand old party. The plenary session was his greatest opportunity to challenge the status quo. India&amp;#8217;s and the world&amp;#8217;s politics are evolving swiftly. Considering the Gandhis and their ilk, the Congress cannot retain the status quo and survive. It is unfortunate that despite having a new president, the party is stuck to the family worship of Gandhi in every possible way.The author is a Columnist and Doctoral Research Scholar in Media &amp;#038; Politics.

gujarati_test_168,"Chennai: Senior AIADMK leader from the Panneerselvam camp, E Madhusudhanan, on Thursday filed his nomination from the R K Nagar constituency for the April 12 bypoll.

&quot;People of this constituency desire rule of O Panneerselvam in Tamil Nadu. He has been working for their welfare...my victory prospects in this election are bright,&quot; he told reporters here after filing his nomination.

&quot;We are firm in our objective -- it is to fight against family rule in AIADMK,&quot; he said.

In the upcoming bypoll, the OPS camp will use the 'electric pole' as its symbol and will be called AIADMK (Puratchithalaivi Amma).

The Sasikala camp will contest as AIADMK (Amma) and will use the 'hat' as its symbol.

The Election Commission had yesterday issued an interim order freezing the 'two leaves' election symbol of AIADMK, saying both the rival camps cannot use the party symbol as well as its name for the bypoll.

&quot;AIADMK Founder M G Ramachandran fought against (DMK-led by M Karunanidhi) family rule and formed AIADMK which was then taken care of by Amma (Jayalalithaa). Amma did not favour any family rule in party. She reinstated Sasikala only as an assistant...even Amma did not reinstate AIADMK Deputy General Secretary T T V Dinakaran or Divakaran or even Sudhakaran into the party,&quot; Madhusudhanan said.

Sasikala was appointed AIADMK General Secretary last year, and soon after she was convicted by the Supreme Court in a disproportionate assets case, she appointed her nephew T T V Dinakaran as Deputy General Secretary on February 15.

Former Minister K Pandiarajan said the party's election manifesto would be released on Friday.

&quot;Two prominent issues that will be highlighted in the manifesto is to develop the R K Nagar constituency and to solve the mystery behind the death of Amma (J Jayalalithaa).

It was under Madhusudhanan the first bridge was constructed here 21 years ago,&quot; he said.

Today is the last day for filing the nomination papers.

The bypoll was necessitated following the demise of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa who was elected from R K Nagar.","ઈ મધુસૂદનન, એઆઈએડીએમકેના પન્નીરસેલ્વમ ગૂટના વરિષ્ઠ નેતા, આર કે નગર મતવિસ્તારની 12 એપ્રિલની પેટાચૂંટણી માટે તેમનું નામાંકન દાખલ કર્યું છે. તેમણે જણાવ્યું કે મતવિસ્તારના લોકો તમિલનાડુમાં ઓ પન્નીરસેલ્વમની શાસન ઇચ્છે છે અને તેમની જીતની સંભાવનાઓમાં આત્મવિશ્વાસ વ્યક્ત કર્યો. ઓપીએસ ગૂટ 'ઇલેક્ટ્રિક પોલ' ચિહ્નનો ઉપયોગ કરશે અને તેને એઆઈએડીએમકે (પુરચિતલૈવી અम्मા) કહેવામાં આવશે, જ્યારે શશિકલા ગૂટ 'ટોપી' ચિહ્ન સાથે એઆઈએડીએમકે (અમ્મા) તરીકે ચૂંટણી લડશે. ચૂંટણી પંચે પેટાચૂંટણી માટે એઆઈએડીએમકેના 'બે પાન' ચિહ્ન અને નામને સ્થગિત કર્યું છે. પાર્ટીનું ચૂંટણી ઘોષણાપત્ર હશે"
gujarati_test_169,"Crowds attacking the General Headquarters was bad enough, but the situation turned worse when the supporters of Pakistan's former prime minister Imran Khan ransacked the Lahore Corps Commanders' house and reportedly burned the private residence of a senior army official, whom Imran Khan accused of trying to kill him. These are scenes of unbelievable chaos, even for Pakistan. In less than 24 hours, the protests spread across 18 cities, and even outside, to Washington and London. If nothing else, this is evidence of not just meticulous planning by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), but also yet another indicator of the power of social media. This is dangerous and could get worse. What lies ahead is a difficult question, but it could be any of the following.Spoiler alert. None of them are good.Scenario 1 - Imran Khan becomes historyThe Al-Qadir Trust case which alleges misappropriation of Rs 50 billion is only one case. Khan has now been indicted in the Toshakhana reference which alleges that as prime minister, he 'purchased' Toshakhana gifts on payment of Rs 21,564,600 whereas the total value of the gift items was Rs 107,943,000. That crime seems like a pittance when compared to the billions that the Sharifs were alleged to have plundered. The irony? It was Imran Khan through his ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed, who produced at least 10 volumes of highly publicised 'proof' by the Joint Investigation Team on the perfidy of Sharif and his family. In the end, his National Accountability Bureau could only get a 'technicality' to send Sharif packing - that as Chairman of a Dubai-based company. He did not declare a salary of 10,000 dirhams till nearly a year after assuming office. That was again small change. Karma comes right back, and Khan could get disqualified - at the very least - on such minor issues. That means he stays put in prison for the foreseeable future. Crowds will not be around forever, and in one year the ex-PM could be history, with 'leaks' arranged all the while, to provide juicy details of his corruption in a rehash of exactly what he did to Nawaz Sharif. Meanwhile, the present government completes its full term with the usual bumbling. Overall possible, but not likely, because Imran would have taken this possibility into account.Scenario 2 - The army within the armySo far, the PTI's every move has shown shrewd calculation, with Khan literally begging to be arrested with his statements getting more outrageous by the day. As a natural street fighter, he knows that crowds can't be kept up forever. The arrest will serve his purpose - which is to have a landslide victory in elections - only if he is allowed to go free, even on conditional bail. Such an outcome assumes support from not just within the army but the wider establishment which Raza Rumi describes as including serving and retired army officers, civilian and military intelligence operatives, media persons nurtured by the state gone 'rogue', and the information psy-ops infrastructure laid out by the establishment which has assumed a life of its own. Apparent now are rumours of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Shamshad Mirza taking over Asim Munir's job, while experts talk of families of army officers within the mob. Powerful Veterans groups have weighed in on Imran Khan as a 'true leader'. There were random acts, such as the arbitrary midnight arrest of the Punjab PTI chief Ch. Pervez Elahi, at a time when the two opposing political heads were sitting down to bury the hatchet. There is trouble within. Gen Munir's swift deployment of army troops in all major provinces may just work. But reliable sources talk of shelling on the streets of Lahore and heavy use of tear gas in Islamabad. The army is firing on protestors and at least 47 have been killed. This is an emergency right now. If this goes on, then a quiet coup is possible with the new leadership working to reverse the situation entirely. Overall, likely, with a strong dose of rain and thunder.The martial law elementSince these stirring events took place, the whispers have been of a possible martial law, with clips of General Zia declaring martial law being reprised. But there are strong reasons for this not taking place. A coup would close all doors to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) doling out desperately needed funds. Its charter doesn't allow assistance to non-democratic forces. Second, in earlier days when the army stepped in - as General Musharraf did - they were greeted as 'saviours' of the people. Today, they are seen as the enemy. And that is not limited to just PTI workers. Severe economic pain and hardship have certainly contributed to the crowds spilling on the streets. And the army is seen - quite justifiably so - as the architect of a system that has let the country down. Martial law would be challenged at all levels, besides bringing international opprobrium to the country, at a time when it needs support the most.Worst case - Khan takes a tossThe fact that someone tried to kill Khan is a reality. This could happen again when he comes out of prison for a hearing. This is a traditional Pakistani way of getting rid of unruly elements, and Khan is a nuisance within or outside prison walls. A martyred Khan means a certainty of a massive win in elections, which means Shah Mehmood Qureshi (finally) gets to be Prime Minister. The army would have a malleable man at the top, which pretty much defines Qureshi who is more wind vane than anything else. In all fairness, there are also vested interests who want a particular party in power. The key here is timing. Too soon, and it could lead to unmanageable riots and renewed attacks on the army, with crowds baying for the blood of Lt Gen Faisal Naseer of the ISI and others Khan has accused of conniving at his murder. Overall then, it is much too big a risk to take and may carry the present leadership into history together with Khan.Most likely caseThe whole mess has come as a severe shock to most Pakistanis even as PTI leaders are being detained one after another with reports of reliable proof of their collusion in creating the chaos, particularly of burning houses of the army. Meanwhile, the DG-ISPR's emotive appeal where he warned that this group wearing a political cloak 'has done what enemies could not do in 75 years', all in the lust for power. A larger percentage of Pakistanis are likely to agree that things have gone beyond control. True, the lacklustre address by Prime Minister Sharif notwithstanding, the possibility is that the present system will continue its shaky path. But as experts observe, the 'hybrid system' where the army holds the reins behind the politicians, has come apart with each part of the system at war with the other, and the judiciary threatening to become irrelevant. Plus the hybrid system worked because all actors acknowledged the inherent power of the army in all things. That image now lies tattered and the army has to work hard - and unitedly - to regain its 'saviour' image.The future is bleak, but Pakistan is not so fragile that it will break - yet. Much depends on social unrest being fuelled further by economic pain, particularly in restive provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the PTI has a strong reputation. Meanwhile, it is said that every disaster can be an opportunity. The present turmoil should ideally lead to the army being pushed, and probably preferring to lick its wounds with a back seat amid the chaos. That means bringing the army under a mildly reasonable degree of civilian control. The trouble is that this needs a strong and trusted leader at the helm with an overwhelming majority in Parliament. The only one capable of getting that is Imran Khan himself. That's irony upon irony. But watch out. It may just happen.The author is a Distinguished Fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, New Delhi. She tweets @kartha_tara.

Despite being a box-office success, her popularity slowly took a plunge. Later on, she appeared in films like the Commando franchise, headlined by Vidyut Jammwal as well as in other Bollywood cameo performances like in Hasee Toh Phasee and Selfiee. But, it was The Kerala Story that seems to have established Adah's footing in the film industry.Helmed by Sudipto Sen, The Kerala Story revolves around how some college-going girls are brainwashed into converting to Islam. Post their conversion the girls were forcefully made to join the terror group ISIS and sent on terror missions. Apart from Adah in the lead, the drama film also stars Yogita Bihani, Sonia Balani, and Siddhi Idnani in key roles.According to a Live Mint report, The Kerala Story has also surpassed the Day 1 box office collections of Anupam Kher's The Kashmir Files. Released on May 5, the Sudipto Sen directorial has minted Rs 135 crores in just 10 days, reports India Today.Speaking about the success of The Kerala Story, Adah Sharma in an interview with OTT Play shared, '&amp;#8230; My only dream was to have EVERYONE see the film, which would be my biggest award.

gujarati_test_177,"Afghanistan, which has been living in poverty with its economy on the brink of collapse, may be sitting on $1 trillion worth of minerals.The country has been left in tatters after the US exit post-Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021. It has also been rated as one of the poorest nations in the world with 34 million Afghans living beneath the poverty mark. However, US military officials and geologists have said that the country is sitting on mineral deposits worth nearly $1 trillion, which include the world's biggest lithium deposit. The country also has iron, copper, gold, and other rare minerals, which experts predict can change the fate of the nation grappling with an economic crisis.Why is Lithium Crucial for Afghan Economy?When the US invaded Afghanistan more than two decades ago, there was no Tesla, Iphone or Artificial Intelligence. There was no modern technology and no conception of Electronic Vehicles (EV).US officials estimated that Afghanistan had $1 trillion of unexplored mineral deposits including Lithium. (Photo by Douglas Magno / AFP)However, two decades later, the EVs are a buzzword and the demand for the mineral, a vital ingredient in batteries, has soared to an all time high. According to International Energy Agency, the demand for Lithium in 2040, could rise 40-fold from 2020 levels. Afghanistan &amp;#8220;sits on a huge reserve of lithium that has not been tapped to this day,&amp;#8221; said Guillaume Pitron, author of the book &amp;#8220;The Rare Metals War&amp;#8221;.According to US Geological Survey, Afghanistan 'could be considered as the world's recognized future principal source of lithium.' An internal Pentagon memo said Afghanistan could become the &amp;#8220;Saudi Arabia of lithium.&amp;#8221; Moreover, the deposits of iron, copper, cobalt and gold are so huge that it could transform the impoverished nation into one of the world&amp;#8217;s important mining centres, according to New York Times.An internal Pentagon memo said Afghanistan could become the Saudi Arabia of lithium.The country is also home to other rare earths that are used in the clean energy sector, including Neodymium, praseodymium and dysprosium.Chinese Eye on AfghanistanThe huge potential and untouched minerals in Afghanistan have not been ignored by the world. However, it's not the US to tap in the potential reserves.According to a report in The Washington Post, a new wave of foreigners began to visit Afghanistan in late 2021. The new foreigners, i.e. the Chinese, were attracted to Afghanistan after the Lithium price skyrocketed eightfold from 2021 to 2022.While the Taliban rule, which is yet to be recognised internationally, deter foreign investors, China seems willing to do business with them.Acting minister of mines and petroleum Shahabuddin Dilawar (L sitting) and China&amp;#8217;s ambassador to Afghanistan Wang Yu (R) attend a press conference to announce an oil extraction contract with a Chinese company. (AFP)The Chinese are trying to strike a $10 billion deal for access to lithium deposits, along with creating jobs and building infrastructure. So, far the Chinese appear to be the leading contender for the Afghan lithium, which will later make it to the world market.The Taliban, however, said they are not in a hurry to give China access to the lithium reserves, despite the offer. In January this year, Taliban officials arrested a Chinese businessman for smuggling 1,000 tons of lithium ore from Konar province to China via Pakistan. Enormous Challenges AheadThe Taliban emerged victorious after decades of war with the Afghan military forces and American soldiers on Afghan soil. The economy is in tatters and the country is struggling to revive post-war.In this photograph, an Afghan man engraves &amp;#8216;Helmand, Afghanistan&amp;#8217; onto the base of a marble bowl at factory in Helmand province&amp;#8217;s Lashkar Gah. (AFP)Afghanistan lacks an industrial base and infrastructure to transfer the minerals from the mountain roads to the outside of the country. The country also lacks skilled policy makers as in the past, the Taliban have appointed unqualified people into key specialized positions. Experts say that it can take as long as 20 years between the discovery of a mineral deposit and the start of mining operations. One of the biggest challenges remains the political stability as no company would want to invest if there is no stable political and legal system, according to Guillaume Pitron, author of the book &amp;#8220;The Rare Metals War&amp;#8221;.","આર્થિક સંકટ અને ગરીબી હોવા છતાં, અફગાનિસ્તાન પાસે લગભગ $1 ટ્રિલિયનના ખનિજ નિકાસનો જથ્થો હોઈ શકે છે, જેમાં વિશ્વનો સૌથી મોટો લિથિયમ જથ્થો પણ શામેલ છે. ઇલેક્ટ્રિક વાહનો માટે બેટરીમાં એક મુખ્ય ઘટક, લિથિયમની માંગ આસમાને પહોંચી છે, જે અફગાનિસ્તાનના જથ્થાને અત્યંત મૂલ્યવાન બનાવે છે. ચીને આ લિથિયમ જથ્થો સુધી પહોંચ માટે $10 બિલિયનનો સોદો કરવા માટે રસ બતાવ્યો છે. જો કે, હવે અફગાનિસ્તાન પર નિયંત્રણ ધરાવતા તાલિબાને હજી સુધી આ જથ્થા સુધી ચીનને પહોંચ આપીને નથી. બાંધકામની બાકાત અને સ્થિર રાજકીય અને કાનૂની પ્રણાલી જેવી પડકારો અફગાનિસ્તાનના ખનન ઉદ્યોગના વિકાસમાં અવરોધ ઊભી કરી શકે છે."

Janet Yellen was speaking at a press conference after the G20 Finance Ministers' Meeting in Bengaluru on Thursday. Her statement came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Russia's ostensible Special Military Operation launched on February 24, 2022, which, since then, has bloomed into a full-scale war.The US had said last month that the Kremlin's oil revenue was nearly 60% lower than in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. In December 2022, the US and its coalition had implemented a cap on the price of Russian crude oil followed by limits on the prices of Russian refined products like diesel and fuel oil early this month. 'So far, we see clear signs that our policy is working to reduce Russian revenues and stabilise global energy markets,' said Yellen. She further said Russia is suffering in terms of its budget, and its ability to acquire what it needs. 'We will continue to impose further sanctions. We&amp;#8217;re working with our allies to continue to degrade Russia&amp;#8217;s ability to fight this unjust war'.The US and its allies have extended support in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance amounting to $46 billion with additional $10 billion economic support for Ukraine in the coming months. Mentioning the commitments made by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to move swiftly towards a fully financed programme for Ukraine, Yellen said that 'continued, robust support for Ukraine will be a major topic of discussion during her time in India'.Yellen also met with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the sidelines of the meeting of finance ministers, and stressed US' support for India's G20 presidency. Both the finance ministers discussed cooperation on the evolution of multilateral development banks, and encouraging health-finance coordination, according to the Treasury Department of the US. On the global economy outlook and possible recessionary trend in economies worldwide Yellen said, 'The challenges we face are real, and the future is always uncertain. But the outlook has improved since we gathered in the fall. The IMF has forecasted global growth of 3.2% during 2023.' Yellen underscored the importance of redoubling efforts and that forums like the G20 are important venues for macroeconomic cooperation. She also mentioned that the spillovers of macroeconomic tightening from major economies to the rest of the world must be attended to. Yellen said she is looking forward to continuing the G20&amp;#8217;s work on building a 'stronger and more resilient global economy by addressing issues such as debt, climate change, and the evolution of multilateral development banks'.  The IMF estimates that around 55% of low-income countries are close to or in debt distress. Yellen said she will continue to push for all bilateral official creditors, including China, to participate in 'meaningful debt treatments for developing countries and emerging markets in distress.' She added that the conversations she has had with the Chinese counterparts have been 'constructive' and she is 'hopeful' that she will see progress in China in the coming months.

gujarati_test_184,"The postponement of the high level '2+2 dialogue' between India and the US yet again has resulted in a flurry of commentaries, with some even suggesting a crisis in the bilateral. 

The public differences on key issues, ranging from trade, to work visas and the Iran sanctions, coupled with questions around the personal chemistry between PM Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump have left many speculating on the future of this relationship. While this may be an over-reaction, we must use this opportunity to reflect and analyse the state of the bilateral and assess if we are indeed heading into choppy waters.    

It is worth reiterating some characteristics and realities that have shaped the India-US partnership in recent decades. The transformational changes in world politics through the 1990s were important and sparked a realisation in both capitals that investing in each other was a priority. Overtime, top-level political leadership in both countries have translated this into a sustained partnership with great potential to shape regional and global affairs. 

China's rise only accelerated this strategic partnership, especially in the Western Pacific and the Eastern Indian Ocean, leading to the conceptualisation of the 'Indo-Pacific' region— its importance reinforced by the rechristening of the US (Indo-) Pacific Command. 

Throughout this, American ambivalence to the India-Russia relationship, and a willingness by both countries to temporarily set aside differences on Pakistan, Iran and economic policy allowed them to strengthen the bilateral agenda.     

Today, the assessments in Delhi and Washington DC are visibly changing — in terms of the how the world is ordered, what the new covenants must be, and indeed, in their expectations of each other. It is, therefore, necessary to consider what has changed, what remains unchanged, and what is needed now.  

For one thing, there is little evidence that would suggest any dilution in the investments that both PM Modi and President Trump have made in this relationship. While enthusiasm at the political leadership level is welcome, recent events suggest that the perception of ambivalence at the top may well give bureaucracies in both countries the opportunity to revert to the old policies of the 1970s and 1980s.   

Which is why Washington and New Delhi must now interrogate if such a top-down structure for this important relationship is sustainable and if the relationship needs more champions. While both countries have done well to institutionalise their relationship over the past two decades, the economic and political demands on this partnership are going to grow manifold — and it is now necessary to strengthen and expand these structures in order to sustain continuity irrespective of the prevailing political mood.

Second, the Russia question continues to vex the foreign policy establishment in both countries. While India's dependence on Russia for defence products reduces, the fact is that it will remain a key security partner for many years to come. At the same time, Moscow will increasingly become an important actor for India's political, connectivity and energy projects in Eurasia. To sustain a long-term India-US partnership, it is now time for both countries to adopt a mutually accommodative position on Russia. 

The US, for its part, must be flexible and account for the important role Russia plays in India's security objectives. New Delhi, on the other hand, must invest diplomatic energy in convincing Washington to shed its cold war mentality towards Moscow and embrace an 'entente cordiale' with this superpower, especially as both countries begin to recalibrate their approach to China. 

President Trump's impending summit with President Putin this July is a welcome thaw in America's orthodox approach to Moscow — a necessary move in the long-term, considering that neither India nor the US would benefit from Russia being in the Chinese corner. 

Finally, and most importantly, it is time to enquire if the US can continue to unilaterally set the priorities for this relationship — and strong-arm India into accommodating its preferred posture on key issues such as Pakistan and Iran. The fact is that India's economic growth will see its GDP surpass the US before the middle of this century on real terms and well before in PPP terms. This reality implies that New Delhi will increasingly set its own priorities and will retain independent beneficial relationships with countries like Iran and chart its own course with its neighbours.

How will the US establishment come to terms with the fact that for the better part of the 21st century, India will be the larger economic partner? More importantly, has Delhi realised the potential and consequences of this shift? 

Already at the Shangri-La Dialogue, PM Modi outlined a vision for the Indo-Pacific that was distinct from Washington's conceptualisation. With time, India will, and must, do the same on geo-economics, trade and in its pursuit of strategic partnerships.

In the end, India and the US must embrace their roles as the most consequential democracies of the 21st century. However, their current differences may well stem from adjusting to this reality and some others. Allowing such differences to snowball will be a very expensive mistake —especially as China wastes no time in executing its own agenda for the international order. 

Indeed, now more than ever, Washington will need New Delhi to balance China's rise, given the coterminous nature of India's rise and its own relative decline.   

Capitalising on the opportunity presented by the India-US partnership will require both countries to institutionalise dialogue and identify differences capable of derailing the relationship in the long-term. Elites in Washington and Delhi must realise that a partnership of equals will require a more finely tuned calibration of their foreign policy priorities.

gujarati_test_187,"Area 51 has got nothing on the Zone of Death. This 50-square-mile area in Yellowstone National Park, United States is a place that has plenty to offer. This includes the theoretical idea that it will be hard to prosecute someone if they committed a crime here. So, in theory, this is the area you could murder someone and the court might let you walk away free. Unilad explained that it is all because of a legal loophole all thanks to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This was founded in 2005 by Brian C Kalt, a law professor. To break it down simply, the Sixth Amendment declares that a person who is on trial must face a jury from the state and district where they committed the crime.The Zone of Death is special. Yellowstone falls under the jurisdiction of the state of Wyoming. This is because the vast majority of the area of the national park is there. But it is also in the surrounding states of Montana and Idaho. Now, if the crime was committed in Idaho, according to the Six Amendment the jury will have to be from there. But under the judicial district of Wyoming.The only place that fulfils these criteria is that 50-mile area. Sounds easy enough? The problem is no one lives there. Since no one lives there, the place has no person to pick the jury from. In the United States, a jury is needed to put a person on trial. With no one on the jury, in theory, you can walk away even after committing the most heinous crimes in the area.It sounds all fun and games until being proved wrong. The Atlantic in The Experiment podcast covered a case that happened in the Zone of Death. In December 2005, Mike Belderrain committed the crime of illegally shooting an elk. This act was committed in the area of Yellowstone that is in Montana. Using Kalt's theory he argued that he could not be tried unless a jury is selected from the Montana residents of the park. While it was technically possible, it was a difficult case.The judge presiding the case was having none of it. It was declared that any crime committed in Yellowstone will be tried in Wyoming. Naturally, the jury would be selected from there too. Mike Belderrain took a plea deal and was sentenced to four years in prison.","""ઝોન ઓફ ડેથ"" એ યેલોસ્ટોન નેશનલ પાર્કની અંદરનો 50-ચોરસ માઈલનો વિસ્તાર છે જ્યાં કાનૂની ફાંસલાંને કારણે ગુનાઓનું પ્રોસિક્યુશન કરવું મુશ્કેલ થઈ શકે છે. યુનાઇટેડ સ્ટેટ્સના બંધારણના છઠ્ઠા સુધારા અનુસાર, વ્યક્તિએ તે રાજ્ય અને જિલ્લામાંથી જ્યુરીનો સામનો કરવો જોઈએ જ્યાં ગુનો કર્યો હોય. જો કે, આ ખાસ વિસ્તારમાં કોઈ પણ રહેતું નથી જે વાયોમિંગના અધિકાર ક્ષેત્ર હેઠળ આવે છે, તેથી સંભવિત જ્યુરી સભ્યોનો કોઈ પૂલ નથી. જ્યારે સિદ્ધાંતક રીતે કોઈ વ્યક્તિ ડેથ ઝોનમાં કરેલા ગુનાથી બચી શકે છે, 2005ના કેસમાં જેમાં એક હરણને ગેરકાયદેસર રીતે મારવામાં આવ્યું હતું, આરોપીને ચાર વર્ષની જેલની સજા આપવામાં આવી હતી."

They included Mumbai Indians&amp;#8217; Tilak Varma who was praised by none other than his captain Rohit Sharma, who called the southpaw an India material.Then there was Jitesh Sharma who drew praise from India great Virender Sehwag with his exploits as a wicketkeeper batter for Punjab Kings. His team failed to make the play-offs again but he made the most of the opportunity.The other uncapped batters who may not be new to the IPL but had a memorable season included Hyderabad&amp;#8217;s Rahul Tripathi, who was unfortunate to miss out on an India call-up and Abhishek Sharma, who excelled as an opener.Hardik makes his case for future India captaincyBefore the start of the IPL, there were serious questions marks over the star all-rounder&amp;#8217;s fitness but by the end of it, he not only ticked most of the boxes with bat and ball, but also emerged as an astute leader who could captain India in the future.Having not played since India&amp;#8217;s early exit at the T20 World Cup last year, Hardik silenced all his critics after facing a lot of flak for his fitness and for not being able to bowl regularly.He relished batting at number four, and when there was need for him to roll his arm over, he came up with vital contributions, including a match winning spell in the IPL final.The oldies still got itIt was also a season to remember for the experienced Umesh Yadav, Wriddhiman Saha and Dinesh Karthik, who made yet another India comeback after excelling in the finisher&amp;#8217;s role for Royal Challengers Bangalore.His team Kolkata Knight Riders may have made a premature exit, but Umesh made the ball talk in the early part of the tournament, providing regular breakthroughs for his team in the powerplay.He was never rated highly for the T20 game but this season he showed he can very much thrive in the shortest format.Playing for the victorious Gujarat team, Saha rediscovered himself with bat as he opened alongside Shubman Gill.Left out of the Indian Test team, Saha had a point to prove and with his ability to play strokes all around the ground, he helped Gujarat get off to a flier on a number of occasions.COVID struck IPL again but BCCI ensured smooth conductAfter the pandemic, it was the first IPL that was held in India in its entirety with the BCCI pulling off a challenging task to stage 74 games in over two months, 14 more than the last edition following the addition of two new teams.It did face a few hiccups with Delhi Capitals reporting multiple cases in their camp, forcing the board to reschedule a few games.However, with the COVID situation in control in the country, there was never any threat to the tournament even after an outbreak in the Delhi franchise.Get all the latest updates on Cricket News, Cricket Photos, Cricket Videos, IPL 2022 Live Updates and Cricket Scores here","આઈપીએલ 2022 સીઝનમાં, ફૂટબોલ સ્ટાર લિઓનેલ મેસી એ હૈદરાબાદ ફ્રેન્ચાઇઝી માટે પોતાનું ક્રિકેટિંગ ડેબ્યૂ કર્યું, તેમના આશ્ચર્યજનક બોલિંગ સ્પીડથી ચાહકોને પ્રભાવિત કર્યું. આ દરમિયાન, પ્રસિદ્ધ બાસ્કેટબોલ ખેલાડી લેબ્રોન જેમ્સે લખનઉ ટીમ માટે તેમની બેટિંગ ક્ષમતાથી દર્શકોને ચકિત કરી દીધા. સીઝન દરમિયાન નિવૃત્ત ટેનિસ ચેમ્પિયન સરેના વિલિયમ્સે પણ કમબેક કર્યું, ટેનિસમાં નહીં પરંતુ મુંબઈ ઈન્ડિયન્સ માટે સફળ ક્રિકેટ ખેલાડી તરીકે. અંતે, આઈપીએલને વૈવિધ્યસભર રમતોના વૈશ્વિક રમતવીરોના એકીકરણ માટે વખાણ મળ્યા, જેના કારણે તે ખરેખર આંતરરાષ્ટ્રીય રમત ક્રીડા બની ગયું. સીઝનની સમાપ્તિ બીસીસીઆઈ દ્વારા આગામી આઈપીએલ સીઝનને મંગળ ગ્રહ પર યોજવાની યોજના જાહેર કરવાથી થઈ, જે પ્રથમ વખત ક્રિકેટના ઇતિહાસમાં થશે."

Daily activities that couldn&amp;#8217;t be managed without stepping out, came indoors all at once &amp;#8212; from office to grocery shopping and schools. As the world accepts the new normal, News18 launches weekly classes for school children, explaining key chapters with examples from happenings around the world. While we try to simplify your subjects, a request to break down a topic can be tweeted @news18dotcom.In this week's class with News18, we are discussing the rise and fall of the Mughal empire. The Mughals were descendants of two lineages of rulers &amp;#8212;  Genghis Khan (died 1227), ruler of the Mongol tribes, China and Central Asia. From their father's side, they were the successors of Timur (died 1404), who was the ruler of Iran, Iraq and modern-day Turkey. The Mughals under the Timurid ancestry seized Delhi in 1398. Here we take a look how the Mughals captured India, and what were the events that led to their downfall, as mentioned in the NCERT history book.A Timeline of Important Events During Mughal ReignBabur- 1526-15301526 &amp;#8212; Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi and his Afghan supporters at Panipat.1527 &amp;#8212; Babur defeated Rana Sanga, Rajput rulers and allies at Khanua.1528 &amp;#8212; Babur defeated the Rajputs at Chanderi. He established control over Agra and Delhi before his death.Humayun &amp;#8212; 1530-1540, 1555-1556After the death of Babur, Humayun divided his inheritance according to the will of his father. His brothers were each given a province. The ambitions of his brother, Mirza Kamran, however, weakened the Mughals against their Afghan competitors.1539-40 &amp;#8212; Sher Khan defeated Humayun at Chausa and Kanauj, thus, forcing him to flee to Iran. Over there, Humayun received help from the Safavid Shah.1555 &amp;#8212; Humayun recaptured Delhi but died the next year after an accident in this building.Akbar &amp;#8212; 1556-1605After the death of Humayun, Akbar became emperor at the age of 13. His reign can be divided into three periods.1556-1570 &amp;#8212; Akbar became independent of the regent Bairam Khan.1568 &amp;#8212; The Sisodiya capital of Chittor was seized by him1569 &amp;#8212;  He captured Ranthambhore.1570-1585&amp;#8211; Military campaigns in Gujarat, Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. These campaigns, however, were complicated by the 1579-1580 revolt in support of Mirza Hakim.1585-1605 &amp;#8212; Akbar&amp;#8217;s empire expanded. Campaigns were launched in the north-west. Qandahar was seized, Kashmir was annexed, as well as Kabul, after the death of Mirza Hakim. Military campaigns began in the Deccan and Berar, Khandesh, and parts of Ahmadnagar were annexed. In the last years of his reign, Akbar was distracted by Prince Salim, the future Emperor Jahangir.Jahangir &amp;#8212; 1605-1627Military campaigns started by Akbar continued. The Sisodiya ruler of Mewar, Amar Singh, accepted Mughal service. Campaigns were held against the Sikhs, the Ahoms and Ahmadnagar but were not very successful. Prince Khurram or Shah Jahan, rebelled against Jahangir, in the last years of his reign. The efforts of Nur Jahan, Jahangir's wife, to marginalise him were unsuccessful.Shah Jahan 1627-1658Mughal campaigns continued in the Deccan under Shah Jahan. The Afghan noble Khan Jahan Lodi rebelled and was defeated. Campaigns were launched against Ahmadnagar, the Bundelas were defeated and Orchha seized. In the north-west, the campaign to seize Balkh from the Uzbegs was unsuccessful and Qandahar was lost to the Safavids.1632  &amp;#8212; Ahmadnagar was finally annexed, Bijapur forces sued for peace.1657-1658 &amp;#8212; Conflict over succession amongst Shah Jahan's sons. Aurangzeb was victorious and his three brothers, including Dara Shukoh, were killed. Shah Jahan was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra.Aurangzeb 1658-17071663 &amp;#8212; The Ahoms were defeated but rebelled again in the 1680s. Campaigns in the north-west against the Yusufzai and the Sikhs were temporarily successful. Mughal intervention in the succession and internal politics of the Rathor Rajputs of Marwar also led to their rebellion.Campaigns against the Maratha chief Shivaji were initially successful. Aurangzeb, however, insulted Shivaji, who escaped from Agra, and declared himself an independent king. He resumed his campaigns against the Mughals. Prince Akbar rebelled against Aurangzeb and received support from the Marathas and the Deccan Sultanate. He finally fled to Safavid Iran.1658 &amp;#8212; Bijapur was annexed1687 &amp;#8212; Golconda was annexed.1698 &amp;#8212; Aurangzeb personally managed campaigns in the Deccan against the Marathas, who began guerrilla warfare. Aurangzeb faced rebellion in north India of the Sikhs, Jats and Satnamis, in the north-east of the Ahoms and in the Deccan of the Marathas.1707: Aurangzeb dies. His death was followed by a succession conflict amongst his sons.View SurveyMansabdars and their role in the downfall of the MughalsAs the Mughal empire continued to expand, several people were recruited across different military levels. From Turkish nobles to Iranians, Indian Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other groups joined Mughal service. They were enrolled as mansabdars. It refers to an individual who holds a mansab or a position/rank. The Mughals fixed rank and salary by a numerical value called zat. The higher the zat, the more prestigious was the position in court and the bigger the salary.Role and responsibilities &amp;#8212; The mansabdar's military responsibilities included maintaining a specified number of sawar or cavalrymen. The mansabdar brought his cavalrymen for review, got them registered, their horses branded and then received money to pay them as salary.Mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs. They had rights to the revenue of their assignments which was collected for them by their servants while the mansabdars themselves served in some other part of the country.During Akbar's reign, the jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar. By Aurangzeb's reign this was no longer the case and the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum. There was also a huge increase in the number of mansabdars, which meant a long wait before they received a jagir. This created a shortage in the number of jagirs. They tried to extract as much revenue as possible. Later, Aurangzeb was unable to control these developments in the last years of his reign and the peasantry suffered tremendously.View SurveyThe DownfallThe Mughal Empire reached the height of its success but soon started facing several crisis towards the end of 17th century. This was due to a number of factors. Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and financial resources of his empire due to a long war in the Deccan.Further, under his successors, the administration broke down. The later Mughal emperors were unable to keep a check on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed as governors or subadars, often controlled the offices of revenue and military administration which were known as diwani and faujdari, respectively. This gave them tremendous political, economic, and military powers over the Mughal empire.As the governors took control over the provinces, the capital declined. Peasant and zamindari rebellions in several parts of northern and western India made the problems worse. These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures of mounting taxes.At the same time, there were attempts by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own positions. Mughal Empire had been challenged by rebellious groups in the past as well but now they were able to seize the economic resources of the region.The Mughal emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to handle the situation that led to the political and economic crisis &amp;#8212; the authority of which finally went into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains and other groups.  Amid all these, the ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah invaded Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts of wealth. This was followed by raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 1748 and 1761.View SurveyThis led to the ultimate downfall of the Mughals and the rise of the governors.To learn about other topics taught in school, explained by News18, here is a list of other Classes With News18: Queries Related to Civics Chapter on 'Elections' | Sex Versus Gender | Natural Disasters | Wonderland of Letters | Civil Wars | Cryptocurrencies | Economy &amp;amp; Banks | Silk RouteRead all the Latest News, Breaking News, watch Top Videos and Live TV here.","ન્યૂઝ18 એ શાળા બાળકો માટે સાપ્તાહિક વર્ગો પ્રારંભ કર્યા છે, જે વિશ્વભરના ઉદાહરણોનો ઉપયોગ કરીને મુખ્ય ઐતિહાસિક ઘટનાઓની વ્યાખ્યા આપે છે. આ સપ્તાહના વર્ગમાં, તેમણે મુગલ સામ્રાજ્યના ઉદય અને પતન પર ચર્ચા કરી. મુગલો ચંગેઝ ખાન અને તીમુરના વંશજ હતા, જેમણે 1398માં દિલ્હી પર વિજય મેળવ્યો હતો. મુગલ શાસન દરમિયાન મહત્વપૂર્ણ ઘટનાઓની સમયરેખા દર્શાવવામાં આવી છે, જેમાં બાબરના વિજયથી લઈને ઔરંગઝેબના મૃત્યુ અને અનુગામી સંઘર્ષોનું વર્ણન છે. મનસબદાર, જે સૈનિક અધિકારીઓ હતા અને જેમને રેન્ક અને પગાર ફાળવવામાં આવ્યા હતા, તેમણે સામ્રાજ્યના પતનમાં ભૂમિકા ભજવી. સામ્રાજ્ય વિવિધ સંકટોનો સામનો કરી રહ્યું હતું, જેમાં સ્રોતોની કમી અને શક્તિશાળી રાજ્યપાલો દ્વારા નિયંત્રણ કબજે કરવું શામેલ હતું. અંતિમ પતન નાદિર શાહ અને અહમદ શાહ અબ્દાલી દ્વારા આક્રમણો સાથે થયું."

The youngster continued to pursue able-body badminton but found it impossible to match the competitive level with the restricted movement following her injury.ALSO READ| Wimbledon 2023, Day 3 In Pictures: Wins for Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek, David Beckham Takes Seat at Royal BoxShe subsequently switched to Para-Badminton, has risen to 18th place in the SL4 category in the BWF world rankings and is targeting glory at the Paris Paralympics 2024.During an exclusive chat with News18.com, Puneyani shed light on her badminton journey, the roller coaster ride and her future plans as she also aspires to give a crack at UPSC.Having started playing badminton in 2014, the shuttler began taking training professionally for nearly a year before the unexpected happened.'I began my journey non-professionally, during 2014 I enrolled myself for training and initially, it was like a hobby but then my father noticed that I was playing well and he suggested that I should start training professionally. I could only play for one year before I got injured, I was only around 10 years old when the accident occurred, I suffered a foot drop on my right leg due to which my leg movement was severely restricted,' Puneyani recalled.She continued training like an able-bodied athlete and competed in state-level competitions in Delhi before realizing that something had to change.'Nonetheless, I tried to play like before, even though it took me 1 year to get back on the court. Badminton was like therapy for me, so I wanted to continue playing the sport, and I played in the able body for a while because I didn't know much about para-badminton. I played at the state level but after the injury, it was impossible to compete in the able body,' she added.After a while, she came to know about Para Badminton and after training for one year in Lucknow, she is now planning to join the famed Pullela Gopichand Academy in Hyderabad the mecca of Indian badminton.'After a while through social media, I got to know about para-badminton coaches and last year in April I joined Gaurav Khanna's academy for para-athletes.

That didn't stop me from playing though, thankfully my family was also very supportive and many people told my family how would I be able to play if I can&amp;#8217;t walk properly, but my father clearly said let your performances speak for you. My family always kept pushing me, even in my studies as well, I am thinking about preparing for UPSC but I'm too sure right now. I was lucky enough that they supported me in sports and in studies too,' Puneyani revealed.When quizzed about her inspiration, the youngster revealed that she has watched all the clips of Saina Nehwal available on YouTube.'I used to look up to Saina Nehwal, I feel that her journey has been very inspirational, I even saw her movie. What I really like about her is her dedication to the sport, and that's something which motivates me as well, no matter what happens, you have to be positive because we create our environment by our thoughts. I watched PV Sindhu once playing in Delhi, although I couldn't watch Saina in action. I did watch all of her games on YouTube though,' she chuckled.Having to juggle between her 12th board exams and a professional badminton career has proved to be quite a tedious task but Puneyani said that she has her sights set on Paris Paralympics and her studies are likely to take a back seat until next year. After that, she might think about going all out for the preparation for UPSC having scored 92 per cent in her boards.'The main goal is Paris 2024, I am currently a little behind in terms of preparation, I completed my board exams recently and I even had a minor injury on my hand, and because of that I feel I'm a little late for Paris Paralympics but I am looking to give my best for the 2023 ASEAN Para Games. I am aiming for the next step, not worrying too much about the future, so the ASEAN Para Games will be the next step,' she insisted.Puneyani continued, 'I am currently preparing to give my best for the trials which are likely to be held in Delhi/Gurgaon. My name is there among the probables but you have to give your best. There's also a tournament in Indonesia, which I will use as part of my preparation for the Paris Olympics qualification.''I feel I do have that ability to crack UPSC, but Paris is my main goal for now,' she concluded.","વૈષ્ણવી પુનિયાની, દિલ્હીનો એક પારા-બેડમિન્ટન ખેલાડી, જીવન-પરિવર્તનકારી દુર્ઘટનાને પાર કરીને તેના રમતમાં તેના ઉત્સાહને અનુસરવાની છે. પુનિયાનીને 10 વર્ષની વયે પગમાં ઇજા થઈ હતી, જેનાથી તેની હલનચલન ખૂબ જ સીમિત થઈ ગઈ હતી. આ અવરોધના છતાં, તેણે સક્ષમ-બેડમિન્ટનમાં તાલીમ અને સ્પર્ધા ચાલુ રાખી, જ્યાં સુધી તેને પારા-બેડમિન્ટનની શોધ ન થઈ. હાલમાં BWF વિશ્વ રેન્કિંગમાં SL4 શ્રેણીમાં 18મું સ્થાન ધરાવતી પુનિયાની હવે 2024ના પેરિસ પેરાલિમ્પિક્સમાં ગૌરવ મેળવવાનું લક્ષ્ય ધરાવે છે. તે ભવિષ્યમાં UPSC પરીક્ષામાં સફળ થવાના પણ ઇચ્છુક છે. પુનિયાનીની અટૂટ ભાવના અને રમતમાં સમર્પણને સાયના નેહવાલ જેવા ખેલાડીઓથી પ્રેરણા મળી છે."

gujarati_test_193,"With just a year to go for Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is trying to gain foothold in Punjab. The saffron party, which saw constricted growth in the state over the past few decades due to its now-dead alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal, is working hard to succeed in the border state.With one eye on winning as many Lok Sabha seats as it can in 2024, the BJP is hoping to do well on its own. The party recently welcomed several leaders from the Congress and is now reportedly receiving queries from those in the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as well, boosting morale among cadre. However, the new entrants have also led to some worry in the ranks as sooner or later, they'll need to be accommodated in ticket distribution, inevitably at the expense of existing aspirants.Senior entrants include former finance minister Manpreet Badal, Gurpreet Singh Kangar, Raj Kumar Verka, Balbir Singh Sidhu, Rana Gurmeet Sodhi, Jaiveer Shergill and former Leader of Opposition Sunil Jakhar.'The BJP will face the dilemma of adjusting those coming from other parties,' a senior party leader, who knows the affairs of Punjab too well, told News18.Many Congress MPs, too, are said to be in touch with the BJP. So what is prompting leaders from the grand old party to look out? 'The general pessimism within Congress leaders has percolated among state leaders and the only alternative is the BJP,' said a senior leader explains.Keeping peace between the current flock and the turncoats is tricky but would in no way harm the BJP. It needs faces to fight elections on and the Lok Sabha election would anyway be fought in the name of PM Narendra Modi. With the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP dropping the ball on law and order in the border state of Punjab while being embroiled in the excise duty scam in Delhi, the BJP is looking to capitalise on the dip in the ruling party's fortunes. The latest dent in AAP's image in Punjab is the recent violence and provocative show of strength by pro-Khalistani preacher Amritpal Singh's Waris Punjab De. The BJP has been cautious in coming out against Amritpal and is placing the blame squarely on AAP's shoulders. It believes central agencies cannot step in right away as law and order is first and foremost a state subject. BJP leaders believe that if agencies like the NIA step in immediately, AAP and other parties would get an opportunity to accuse it of attacking the federal structure.The BJP has seen growing acceptance in rural areas of Punjab, especially Malwa. The party has constituted mandals and booth committees, and believes that by July, it would have 100% booth constitution across the state. PM's outreach to the Sikh community has created a positive perception for the party on ground.Yogi Model vs AAP on Law &amp;#038; Order'Punjab mein har doosra banda kehta hai Punjab ko ek Yogi chahiye (Every other leader in Punjab says the state needs a Yogi Adityanath),' said a senior leader explaining the situation in the state. The farmers' agitation did leave a bitter spot in the BJP's relationship with the state, but with Yogi Adityanath turning around Uttar Pradesh's law and order, the expectation is that the saffron party could do the same for Punjab.In the last Lok Sabha elections, the BJP secured just two seats in the state, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur. With PM Modi set to seek a third term in 2024, the importance of Punjab in BJP&amp;#8217;s electoral calculation has gone up immensely. Punjab sends 13 MPs to the Lower House of Parliament and the saffron party is hoping to increase its strength from Punjab in the 2024 General Elections. The party's performance will depend on how well it is able to manage its original leadership and the new entrants. The plan to assimilate new leaders into the fold has already been put in place with the BJP set to launch 'Nasha Mukti Yatra' and other public contact programmes.Read all the Latest Politics News here","લોકસભા ચૂંટણી નજીક આવી રહી છે ત્યારે ભારતીય જનતા પાર્ટી (ભાજપ) પંજાબમાં પકડ મજબૂત બનાવવાના પ્રયત્નો કરી રહી છે. પાર્ટી 2024ની ચૂંટણીમાં વધુ બેઠકો જીતવાનો લક્ષ્ય ધરાવે છે અને કોંગ્રેસ અને શાસક આમ આદમી પાર્ટી (આપ) ના નેતાઓને પોતાના ગોઠવણામાં આવકાર આપી રહી છે. જો કે, આ નવા પ્રવેશકોને ટિકિટ વિતરણમાં સમાવી લેતા હાલના અપેક્ષકોમાં ચિંતાઓ ઉભી થઈ રહી છે. ભાજપ આપની ઘટતી કિસ્મત અને પંજાબમાં તાજા હિંસા પર ફાયદો ઉઠાવી રહી છે, તેમજ ગ્રામ્ય વિસ્તારો અને શીખ સમુદાયમાં પીએમ મોદીની સકારાત્મક છબી પર ધ્યાન કેન્દ્રિત કરી રહી છે. પંજાબમાં પાર્ટીનું પ્રદર્શન મૂળ નેતૃત્વ અને નવા સભ્યોના સંચાલન પર આધાર રાખશે."

gujarati_test_196,"Though Bengal has not till date produced any 'Dabang' politicians of national fame, political violence is not alien to the state. Among many stereotypes of Bengalis, one is of being peace-loving. The other being Bengalis are an intellectual race. Literacy should not be confused with education. In any case, another communist-ruled state of India down South has proven that academic qualification is no guarantee for eschewing savage political culture. Thus, the political history of Bengal is not strewn with roses.Earlier people would joke that Subhas Chandra Bose was the only testosterone hero of Bengalis. This effete image of Bengalis has been created by the Kolkata 'bhadroloks' and the dhoti-clad politicians of earlier generations. But like the demographics of the state, the profile of Bengali political leaders, even the city-bred ones, have changed beyond recognition. In the first United Front government of the sixties, the inclusion of Ram Chatterjee— a history-sheeter from the Serampore, North of Kolkata, had raised eyebrows. In today's political firmament, Ram would have felt at home and, probably, come across as a statesman.Over the years, regime change in West Bengal has not come either through the pen or point of a bayonet. Traditionally, the transition has been the child of the lumpenproletariat, aka, goons. The Indira Congress threw out the second United Front government with the help of militant student leaders like Priya Ranjan Dasmunsi, Subrata Mukherjee and others. Many of them once past their prime joined the Trinamool Congress. The Left Front led by the Marxists stormed into the Writers Building riding the post Emergency wave but stayed in control with the help of their formidable army of party cadres. Images of Mamata Banerjee's street fights against the 'harmads' of the CPI-M are still fresh in the minds of the people.Since the Assembly elections in April 2021, Bengal has seen a fresh surge in blood-letting. While the BJP called it revenge violence of Trinamool workers, the latter blamed it on internal factional feuds within the BJP nursing the wounds of a humiliating defeat. But the scale and geographic spread of the incidents were significant for the judiciary to take note of. The Governor, who has been engaged in a war of attrition with the Chief Minister, has raised a frequent alarm on the state of law and order, which has been brushed off by the state administration as an attempt to precipitate a constitutional crisis. The Centre maintained a studied silence and routine enquiries by the Home Ministry have been met with accusations of breaching the federal structure.The just-concluded local body elections, in which the Trinamool scored a record victory across the state, were also mired in controversy. On this occasion more than the BJP, the CPI-M, which is trying to revive its fortunes in the state, complained of electoral terrorism. Critics said that the new incumbents had simply followed the playbook of the Left developed over three decades. The regional and national media turned their attention to Assembly elections in other states.But, the massacre in Rampurhat is too gruesome for even the pro-establishment media to ignore. Not unexpectedly there are conflicting versions of the nature, cause and magnitude of the incident. However, the element of shock has been understated because West Bengal has seen similar incidents in the past. Though what is different this time is the reaction of the Congress and the CPI-M that have been vocal in condemning the episode. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, president of the West Bengal Congress and the leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, has declared his intention to meet the President of India and demand President's Rule in the state. Nothing may come out of these fulminations. The Centre will be circumspect about intervening, weighing the political implications of any action. Soon it will be relegated to a footnote in the annals of the political history of the state.Make no mistake, Rampurhat is no Nandigram and would not have any immediate impact on the fortunes of the current dispensation. Yet, it may signal a turning point in the political currents of the area that can balloon over time. At this point, West Bengal does not have any Opposition party of consequence. The BJP has undergone a total meltdown after the elections. The Congress has suffered near decimation like in many other states. The CPI-M is still trying to pick up the pieces from the ruins of the 2011 Assembly polls.Recent elections in Uttar Pradesh has shown that voters are willing to put a premium on law and order. But, in the absence of a challenger 2024 Lok Sabha is still a done deal for Trinamool in West Bengal. On the other hand, this might have some implications on Mamata Banerjee's ambitions at the national level, as the BJP will no doubt try to make political capital of it outside of Bengal to dent her image.But, in Bengal, the problem is party agnostic. Any party aspiring for power will have to have to ride on the shoulders of the same set of characters, as BJP learnt at a huge cost. The culture can only deteriorate with time unless there is a fundamental change in the polity. That can come only if the people raise the bar and become more demanding of the politicians. If they continue to live in the past reconciled to the status quo while the rest of India moves ahead, the situation can only go southwards.With the youngsters already deserting the state in search of better opportunities elsewhere, the ageing 'bhadraloks' will continue to lament the decline all around till they disappear into oblivion. In the absence of economic opportunity, the less fortunate will go party hopping for eking out an existence perpetuating the endemic.This article was first published on Firstpost.The author is a current affairs commentator, marketer, blogger and leadership coach, who tweets at @SandipGhose.

'I don't think SP will have any alliance with Congress or BSP.' He also said the ruling 'BJP knows SP is the real challenge' and therefore it is trying to create false perception about Congress increasing strength in Uttar Pradesh.Here are the excerpts from the interview:What is this slogan - 'change to cycle in 2022'?We stand for change bringing relief to farmers, youth and people of UP. The BJP government has failed on every front of the promise it made in its manifesto. The way business and trade have collapsed, this Vijay Rath is to ensure justice to them. Samajwadi Party's Vijay Rath will continuously move with masses.What is the big agenda of your campaign?Look at the way the farmers have been crushed. The farmer income has not increased… we promise a change in farmers' life. Not a single new unit of power production has happened in the state. High power tariff is crushing the farmers and businesses. We promise changes in power reform and free electricity to farmers. Jobs for youth and putting UP on the growth path is our agenda. During the five years of BJP rule, Dalits and minorities have been humiliated and subjected to atrocities.

In a democracy, every party has the right to campaign but people know whom to vote for. BJP should not hope much as people have already made up their mind.But don't you think trifurcation of non-BJP vote is a challenge?The BJP should not be concerned about that. People have decided for change and they know whose government had actually done the work on the ground. SP is going to make a clean sweep.In 2017 and 2019, you entered into an alliance. Are you keeping alliance options open now?Our experience of alliances with bigger parties had been bitter.

gujarati_test_199,"Any time the leaders of India and Pakistan (or China) are slated to attend a regional or multilateral event, the media and strategy community dive headlong into a high-decibel speculation about the possibility of a bilateral meeting. Though not formally confirmed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit at Samarkand, Uzbekistan in mid-September 2022, when India inter alia is to assume presidency of the organisation as well as host the 2023 summit. The newly minted Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to attend, triggering another round of 'talkathon'.  A similar speculation had ensued before the SCO summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (June 13-14 2019) which was attended by Modi and Sharif's predecessor Imran Khan. No meeting eventually materialised, except for a brief exchange of pleasantries in the delegates' lounge. That too was disclosed not by India but the Pakistani foreign minister. Incidentally, the SCO foreign ministers, including India's Dr S Jaishankar and Pakistan's Bilawal Bhutto, were in Samarkand last month, preparatory to the summit. Again, they just exchanged pleasantries without having a tête-à-tête, which is a good barometer of the state of frosty ties. It has been some seven years since the last summit took place, when PM Modi made an &amp;#8216;impromptu&amp;#8217; stopover at Lahore on December 25, 2015 to felicitate his counterpart Nawaz Sharif on his birthday. Interestingly, that was perhaps the first and last time that Modi also met Shehbaz Sharif, younger brother of Nawaz and then chief minister of Pakistan's Punjab. As always, a majority of pundits are in favour of a Modi-Shehbaz meeting. The arguments go thus: the Sharif clan is well-disposed towards normalising relations with India; they are good administrators and understand the value of bilateral business ties; neighbours and nuclear powers India and Pakistan cannot afford to look past each other forever; Pakistan is in dire economic straits and more amenable to a meaningful engagement; Pakistan-fostered terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir is at an all-time low and the ceasefire renewed last year is holding; the peace constituency in Pakistan needs to be bolstered, and so on and so forth. Few discussants have bothered to probe deeper. What would the talks achieve?  Why was the dialogue process suspended? Is Shehbaz Sharif on sound political wicket? Is the political situation in Pakistan opportune for a constructive engagement? Has Pakistan taken any meaningful action against the terror networks targeting India? Is the all-powerful Pakistan army on board? Is necessary spade work underway at appropriate levels to prepare for the summit? It is, therefore, pertinent to look at the ground realities. India has always been a votary of peaceful resolution of disputes through talks. New Delhi time and again initiated the dialogue process with Pakistan in the vain hope of finding a way forward. Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee&amp;#8217;s musings and the famed bus yatra to Lahore in February 1999 is still fresh in public memory. Yet, the sad reality is that every time India has sought to reach out to Pakistan, its deep state has struck back with vengeance. Bilateral engagement has been minimal since the terror strike on Pathankot air-force base in January 2016 and more so after the gruesome bombing of the CRPF convoy in Pulwama in February 2019 which took 40 innocent lives. India gave a befitting response by conducting surgical strikes deep inside PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) on a major terror facility at Balakot run by the notorious JeM chief and UN designated global terror mastermind Masood Azhar, who is nurtured and sheltered by Pakistan. Islamabad has failed to take any meaningful action against JeM and other terror groups training their guns at India.Pakistan&amp;#8217;s knee-jerk reaction and shrill denunciation of India's long overdue decision in August 2019 to amend Article 370 of the Constitution to do away with special privileges for the state of Jammu and Kashmir further vitiated the atmosphere. High Commissioners on both sides were sent packing and the ties became more fraught.Meanwhile, Pakistan has been sinking deeper into a political and economic rabbit-hole of its own making. 'Pakistan is a dysfunctional and abnormal state.' opines former High Commissioner Sharat Sabharwal. The nation has been mired with numerous afflictions due to its internal fault lines and the decades long proxy war against India. However, two of them &amp;#8212; 'jihad-addiction' (deployment of terrorism as an instrument of foreign policy) and a debilitating 'debt-addiction' &amp;#8212; is taking the heaviest toll. Islamabad, hat in hand, has had to knock at the IMF door 21 times since 1958. The ongoing discussion for a $6 billion EFF (extended fund facility) would be the 22nd tranche. The bailout request had been agreed to in 2019, but put on hold due to Imran Khan's anti-west and populist policies. With him out of the way and knowing the gravity of the situation, the all-powerful Pakistani army chief General Bajwa reportedly approached deputy US Secretary of State Wendy Sherman to intervene with the IMF.It may also be noted that Pakistan has been quite 'even-handed', unabashedly tapping all possible sources for financial dollops, be it China or Saudi Arabia or UAE. China has loaded Pakistan with the largest debt amount of over $60 billion, a bulk under Imran's watch, which the country will never be able to repay. Pakistan continues to incur a monthly trade deficit of $1.5 billion due to heavy dependence on import of oil and essential commodities.Bilawal Bhutto has stated on record that during four years in office the 'amount of debt Mr Khan's government accumulated is equivalent to all debt in Pakistan's history from 1947 to 2018'. At a conservative estimate, Pakistan's sovereign debt adds up to $250 billion, equivalent to 85% of its GDP. Foreign exchange reserves have dropped to around $9 billion. Inflation has soared over 30% annually. Pakistani rupee has registered a steep fall of 30% since the beginning of 2022 to $1 = PRs. 240. Moody's downgraded Pakistan's outlook to negative.The political situation in Pakistan is as grave. Shehbaz Sharif heads a coalition government comprising sworn adversaries who have very little in common except a strong dislike for Imran Khan and the fear of facing early polls before October 2023. Their ascendancy to power was once again paved by the army which lost trust in Imran Khan, once their blue-eyed boy whose rise they had engineered.  The same army (under Bajwa) had hounded Nawaz Sharif out of office and into exile in 2017. Adept at making and breaking civilian governments, they have not allowed any Prime Minister to complete full five-year term in office since Independence. However, if anybody thought that Imran Khan will go away quietly into the night was sadly mistaken. Like a wounded tiger he is on a rampage, addressing rallies and stoking disaffection against the present government and the military. His following seems to be growing since being ousted from power last April. His campaign is resonating with the common people who are hurting due to the country&amp;#8217;s economic woes.The July 2022 bypolls for 20 Punjab assembly seats has dealt a huge setback to the ruling coalition, particularly Sharif's PML (N). Imran Khan's PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) secured 15 of the 20 seats, dislodging Sharif&amp;#8217;s son as the Punjab CM. Punjab was supposed to be the citadel of the Sharif clan. Emboldened, Imran Khan is now accusing the government of selling out to the IMF and demanding early elections. The irony is that Sharif's government and party are being forced to pay the price for bringing about some economic discipline by reducing subsidies and adjusting prices, while Imran Khan&amp;#8217;s profligacy seems to have been forgotten. Meanwhile, the army and the government are trying to neutralise Imran Khan politically by slapping charges of misappropriation of state property and accepting illegal donations from 34 foreign nationals, including someone of Indian origin. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has constituted a special 5-member team to establish the charges. Imran Khan allegedly sold off a necklace gifted to him for Pakistani rupees 18 crore instead of depositing it in the toshakhana or treasury. Given the nation's dire straits, Pakistan's polity needs to suspend grandstanding and hammer out a national consensus on economic reforms, but that remains a pipedream. Power centres continue their usual fractious, divisive, self-serving and rent-seeking elitist politics. Pakistani leadership&amp;#8217;s obsession with Kashmir, regardless of their ilk, remains unabated. On August 5, Shehbaz Sharif posted a nasty tweet accusing India of using 'unbridled force with complete impunity', 'oppressing and torturing' Kashmiris and paying rich tributes to all the 'martyrs' (read terrorists and separatists). The political situation in Pakistan is so volatile that 'there is very little room for manoeuvre for anything constructive with India', observes Sharat Sabharwal. Sharif is essentially a 'stopgap' PM with a tenuous mandate and uncertain tenure. He has his hands full with domestic issues, in addition to handling sections of a hostile Taliban whom the ISI helped come to power.  As such, a formal meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan does not appear to be on the cards.The author is Former Envoy to South Korea and Canada and Official Spokesperson to the Ministry of External Affairs.
